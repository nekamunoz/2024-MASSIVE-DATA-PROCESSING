{"input":"Another aspect to note is that patients who see palliative care earlier have a much better prognosis - longer survival times and higher quality of life scores.","output":"Pulmonologist here. I am also the medical director of a hospice for the last 15 years. First, I am very sorry for the difficulty that you, your father, and your family are having to deal with. As a physician, and particularly in doing pulmonary/critical care as well as hospice, I have tried to help people through these tough situations for most of my career. Each case is individual and each patient is an individual with their own beliefs and values and dreams.Over the years, I've spoken to many dying patients and their families about their illness, and what I've tried to do is to give them the perspective of a physician in order that they can then use their own values and beliefs within the framework of a physician's perspective...using what we know and applying their own perspective.As a physician, my perspective on your father is that he is dying. Please don't take that as callous...it is not meant that way. Most people think of dying as a moment...and it certainly can be...car wreck, heart attack, massive stroke... those thinks can take a life in the blink of an eye. However, for many, if not most, people...dying is a process. It can be several hours or several weeks...or longer It begins when you know that nothing else can be done for the patient and all you are trying to do is maintain, and despite your best efforts, the trend is that the patient continues to decline. All patient's have good days and they have bad days, but for a dying patient, when you average it out, the trend is that they continue to worsen.It's at this point that I think it's important to find out what kind of death your father really wants. That can sound very brutal to some people...but remember, we're physicians and we experience this life and death everyday, and we see patients who die peacefully and comfortably and we see patient's who die alone and in horrible circumstances. With those experiences in mind and with our practicality, we begin to think about what we would want for ourselves. Ask any physician or nurse friend of yours...chances are they've thought about it a lot...far more than other people. They tend to know exactly how far they're willing to go before they just want comfort.From your post, you've spoken to your Dad about his care:He's expressed that no matter how small the chance is, he wants to continue fighting. We've had this talk serveral times throughout the years. Even now he expresses this. Which is why I'm trying to explore every realm of possibility.When he says \"chance,\" what does he mean? Chance of a cure?...chance to go back home?...chance to get a little better and be off the ventilator? In other words, you need to know what his goals are. If his goal is cure, there is no chance. If his goal is going home to the way his life had been...there probably is little chance of that either, though there may be a chance to go home...I don't have enough information. But first, find out which of his goals are potentially achievable with his doctors. Once you know what goals are potentially achievable for your father, you and his doctors can talk about what would have to happen to achieve those goals.Eventually...at some point however, because of the nature of our existence, none of those goals will be achievable, and at that point it is reasonable to give your father permission to let go and to seek comfort in the final moments, days, or weeks of his life. I say that because many patients continue to fight because they think that's what they're suppose to do or because they think they'll be letting down their family if they let go. They endure unnecessary suffering because no one has offered them a path of comfort and acceptance or because they made a vow to fight on and they don't want to renege on a promise they made to someone.We all eventually die. Some of us will never know what hit us because it comes too quickly. For those of us who are struck with a terminal illness like cancer, the only benefit is that we may have enough time to get our personal affairs in order and make peace while having some control over the dying process. As a physician, I know how I'd want to die, however, I don't try to push that on any of my patients. There are definitely patients who don't want to do much at all and just want to enjoy what life they have left. There are other patients who can't die in peace without trying everything including investigational treatments. I respect them all but as a physician I have to make sure that they are making those decisions knowing all the facts and the possibilities and risks.Start by talking to your father about his goals and discussing those goals with your father and his doctors. Give your father permission to do what he wants whether it's letting go or fighting to his last breath. And make sure that in the end, his comfort and wishes guide what decisions you may have to make in his stead. I hope this helped a bit. As best as I can on a reddit post, I'd like to give you, your father, and your family a big hug and my wishes that you all will be comforted in the days ahead."}
{"input":"Anti CCP Antibodies. And would recommend having the bloods done during the flare up with inflammation markers like ESR/CRP. Definitely sounds Autoimmune in nature.","output":"Yeah, during a flare up is the best choice. I saw that they already had CRP done and it was normal"}

{"input":"As the physicians here have responded, go to ERnow. And please update! Very curious to hear his outcomes. Best of luck to you","output":"Does he use drugs, specifically marijuana?Food allergies? It would be a bit drastic, and may not explain the swelling, but you can develop them at any time.A bit young for cancers, but maybe he is genetically predisposed, getting at least a CT scan with contrast of his abdomen would be good.This is concerning for his heart too, as mentioned.He needs quick workup, as mentioned. Worrisome is not eating and what his electrolytes are like.Not that being obese is the sole cause of his symptoms, but he should lose weight. Almost every physician you will run into will say this as it is important for his health, just as they would tell him to stop smoking if he was smoking."}
{"input":"CLL was brought up bc of the higher absolute lympho count and the moderated smudge cell. The ER doc wrote it on discharge to pcp.","output":"I'm a ED physician, and this...sounds unusual. In CLL, the white count should be significantly elevated which in this case, it is not. Furthermore, the presence of smudge cells is not necessarily indicative of CLL. I be surprised if this was CLL. This is likely some sort of viral infection if I had to guess."}

{"input":"Could they slip a written note to the tech or doctor to not verbally mention the IUD in front of mom?","output":"In conservative Muslim countries, it's not uncommon for doctors to share information about adult children with their parents. It would not be safe to send this type of note/email and risk it being shared with the parents.Read more here. (Excerpt from \"Factors influencing sexual and reproductive health of Muslim women: a systematic review\" below)\" Unmarried women seemed to be concerned with healthcare providers informing family members about their visits and expressed worries regarding providers sharing information discussed during consultations. For some single women, family members often accompanied them during health visits, making it impossible for them to discuss any issues privately.A study in Egypt revealed that although patient records were stored securely in filing cabinets in the family planning clinics, a number of healthcare providers stated that they allowed family members to view womens health records. In addition to providers lack of respect for confidentiality, another contributing factor is that in the Egyptian family health model, womens medical records are a part of the combined family health records and could be easily accessed by any family member \""}
{"input":"Definitely call the Dr on call now.","output":"Your symptoms would not match anything you described may or may not be on your MRA images.

{"input":"Did they ever do an angiogram while you were symptomatic? Or a mri or Ct with contrast while you had active symptoms?","output":"The problem with the studies you received such as the MRI and CTA is they dont have the resolution to see smaller blood vessels. This would require a biopsy. Some medium and small vessel diseases respond to immune suppression with steroids etc, the treatment for Buergers is not smoking. Others such as livedoid vasculopathy (a vein disease) require anticoagulation.So again not vaping is essential to save your legs. Wouldnt recommend other nicotine containing products such as patch or gum, but bupropion and varenicline are effective smoking cessation aids.Personally if smoking cessation isnt effective and the symptoms progress I would want the biopsy despite the admittedly very high wound healing risk. There may be a proximal area with less advanced disease that is amenable, and your symptoms are end-stage.Can PM me if you have specific questions."}
{"input":"Did they inform him of the Burn Pit Registry through the VA?","output":"These look like theyre due to an exotic infectious agent.

Someone should be following up sooner with these numbers.If interested, there is also a website run by a physician with myeloma that tracks labs and has physicians from all over weigh in on care. Its free and worth looking into if you are not close to a large academic center."}

{"input":"I put it in my post! Theres a lot of screenshots lol, so beware, but its every test result Ive received most recently (September 11th).","output":"Is it just your arms that are blue? And the right started before the left?QYes, just my arms. The left one started turning blue before the right one, its the blood oddity that started in the right. My lips used to also occasionally turn blue months and months ago, but now its strictly my arms.Sorry it took so long to get back to you things have been crazy on my end with covid. Ive been thinking a lot about your case over the last few days. I think its really strange that its only your upper extremities that are changing color. Please keep an eye out for color changes on your legs or other body parts. Typically when there is some form of differential cyanosis (one part is blue and others arent) we think of cardiac defects and if its one specific limb poor perfusion. But given your age and normal echo a cardiac defect causing your symptoms is unlikely. My next best guess would be something like pernicious anemia/B12 deficiency. This could explain your developing anemia and some of your pain symptoms. The blue coloring could be due to easy bruising related to it. However given that you have microcytic anemia (small red blood cells) and we typically see a macrocytic anemia (big red blood cells) with pernicious anemia/B12 deficiency. But that doesnt necessarily rule out that as a cause for you symptoms. To evaluate this you would start by checking b12, folate levels. Like other have mentioned you could have a hemoglobinopathy causing the cyanosis and anemia which would be more consistent with your microcytosis. However I would have expected this to show up before now, have some known family history of anemia or bleeding disorders, and/or have cyanosis or bruising on more of your body than just your arms. My best guess would be some kind of vasculitis causing vasospasm in your arms giving them a cyanotic appearance. The vasculitis could also be causing the pain you experience in your legs. Your developing microcytic anemia could be early anemia of chronic disease with maybe a pinch of iron deficiency thrown in. Id recommend asking for a ferritin and iron level to evaluate the anemia more. In terms of vasculitis workup, its a bit out of my wheelhouse so Id recommend considering seeing a rheumatologist for further evaluation. Those docs typically (or at least the ones I have worked with) are more of the safari guides than other docs and specialize in zebras.Tl;dr: Possibly a vasculitis, consider rheumatology. Also could be B12 deficiency/pernicious anemia or hemoglobinopathy but less likely due to nerd stuff as above.*edit: Like to add that you should probably also consider seeing a hematologist as well if you havent."}

Some say 16-18.Most boys do not continue to grow past 19. Some do. Most do not.This is why male growth charts norms plateau at 16-17 years, but weight continues upward.It might be commonly said to be 19-21 in your country's education system, but that's not accurate.If you're able to find a source that says it's typical to keep growing into your 20s, there 100 others that say it's not.This is common pediatric knowledge.You think you're right here, because lay people have told you this while growing up, but it's not medically accurate."}

Did you see my other comment about the CALR test type?","output":"Yeah -- so it's almost certain you don't have a classic CALR mutation (type 1 or type 2) but some small possibility remains you have an atypical one.If you end up getting a bone marrow biopsy done by someone (you can always ask the rheumatologist to order one and see what they say), you can always try to get a comprehensive NGS panel done on the resulting sample. Depending on who your healthcare system contracts with, this is usually a 50-75 gene panel that would include JAK2, CALR, and MPL, as well as various other genes commonly mutated in myeloid malignancies. It could still be negative, though -- about 1/4 to 1/3 of the NGS panel cases I sign out are negative. Hopefully this is something your insurance would pay for, as this is a very pricy test."}

If it were me, I would absolutely be looking at UDN. Let them decide whether you're eligible or not. I'm just trying to provide perspective about what to expect."}

{"input":"That doesnt sound good.","output":"Yes, this partThey said there were nodes in his lungs, but that they werent treating and just want to keep an eye on until mid December, then talk about what to do if they grow. The problem is, he is weak and is having trouble breathing.doesn't sound good at all. Sounds like his metastases are growing pretty fast when he's already noticing bulging from lymph nodes and trouble breathing from lung metastases. But we don't really have enough information to make this determination right now. Missing information:The exact histopathology (is it clear cell renal cell carcinoma or something more exotic?)Imaging reportsThe date of imaging and surgery to get a feeling for the timeline and progression dynamicsWhy his treating physicians said that \"his body encapsulated the tumor\" when they also said he has lung metastases, and why they didn't indicate systemic therapy and why they seemed to think his prognosis is good.Taking the most likely case based on incomplete information: In metastatic classic clear cell renal cell carcinoma, no chemotherapy is indicated ever, because chemotherapeutic agents don't help, which has been tried and demonstrated over and over. Effective medications are immunotherapy (checkpoint inhibitor antibodies like pembrolizumab), TKIs (tyrosin kinase inhibitors that can be taken orally, like sunitinib, pazopanib, cabozantinib or axitinib) and as probably less effective alternatives medications that inhibit vascular growth (e.g. bevacizumab or lenvatinib) or mTOR-inhibitors (e.g. temsirolimus).What's indicated precipitates on your husband's other medications, comorbidities, performance status (overall health) and other stuff.Also, in oligometastatic renal cell carcinoma, locally ablative therapies can be used to kill all the metastases you can detect at the moment, for example radiosurgery, microwave ablation etc., but your husband's case doesn't sound like that from the very limited information we got.Edit: As /u/Porencephaly already wrote, your next step is to contact his oncologist's office. They need to determine what the problem is right now (maybe it's even an infection and not metastatic progression) probably with new CT imaging and formulate a plan of action.His trouble breathing could be due to anemia, or a number of infections, or heart problems, or lymph node metastases compressing blood vessels or a bronchus, or pleural effusion, or whatever else... this is all more probable than trouble breathing due to lung metastases themselves, which surpisingly rarely are symptomatic in this way."}

{"input":"Thats exactly what I did. I was told you could use it on that area and even on the ankle to replicate different ECG (EKG?) leads. Thank you for the info!! Phew!","output":"It would be theoretically possible to get a tracing with accurate wave morphology between 2 limbs with an Apple Watch, but it could be inverted if the polarity is switched.

If your team thinks shes ready for room air overnight, particularly given her vigorous attempts to pull the cannula off, I think thats a good sign.Let her alarm do the work. You shouldnt have to be staying up next to her like this. The alarm can tell you when shes going longer than 10 seconds in the 80s. These short blips dont matter as much. If it alarms, just keep track of how many alarms overnight youre having, how long, and the low number reached during the desat. The monitor should be tracking this for you.Its okay. You are doing so much hard work for your daughter right now and are asking a lot of really important questions about how to give her the best treatment and recovery; that shows me that you are taking great care of her.

The reason I ask is I have friend who was bit by a spider while in Afghanistan and he still suffers complications from the wound site. While not near as extreme as what OPs husband is going through, but is it possible that OP is suffering from some sort of parasite or long term degeneration from venom? Would that turn up on any clinical tests? And do you think it would be prudent for OP to contact medical professionals in the country where OP was originally exposed?Has he had biposies of the lesions?QYes he has had biopsies several in fact alot of them come back as a burn but that's not the proble.

If someone has non-clear cell histology, the preferred regimens change a bit (and clinical trial is much preferred) but a lot of the same treatments are used.For someone who has a large burden of disease and is symptomatic from it, a combo of VEGF inhibitor + immunotherapy might be better than immunotherapy alone, just because the response rate is faster. But ultimately the choice depends a lot on factors like what other medical conditions someone has and what side effects theyre willing to tolerate, because we dont have any head-to-head trials showing that one regimen is better than the other."}

Look this calculator up online. Most people stand an annualized risk of 2-11% of experiencing stroke. On a day to day basis, that risk is super small. Like 0.001% chance of having a stroke every day he's off anticoagulation, and even that is probably an overestimate of his stroke risk.The risks of bleeding are obvious. He's bleeding into his GU tract. This could occlude his bladder. He could bleed into the wound bed in ways that make his recovery worse. The chance of bleeding while anticoagulated is 100%.The last nail in the coffin is that we have multiple large and well-designed trials (BRIDGE and PERIOP2) that show no benefit to bridging pre or postoperatively in any population we've looked at this far, including mechanical valves in the post-op setting.At this point the only cases where bridging might be worth it is acute DVT/PE within 3 months of surgery, and maybe mechanical mitral valve."}
