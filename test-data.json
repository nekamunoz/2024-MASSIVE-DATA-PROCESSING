{"input":"1 year old sudden loss of visionOn Thursday, my 15 month olds babysitter noticed that she wasnt making eye contact like normal. At home, I noticed the same thing. Normally, if I look at her and smile she smiles back. But it looked like she was looking right past me. Along with that, she was not tracking objects with her eyes.I took her to the pediatrician on Friday who was concerned and wanted her to see an ophthalmologist right away. So we did that, she had a full eye exam with her eyes dilated and there was nothing wrong (like far sightedness or strabismus etc) with her eyes. The ophthalmologist was concerned too and called a neurologist who wanted us to go to the ER so we could be admitted into neurology over the weekend.The ER did a lot of blood work, a spinal tap for fluid (I cant remember the name- Im sorry.) and the doctors there just generally said they were stumped.We are on day 2 of being in the pediatric neurology unit. Shes having an EEG done for 24 hours and hopefully an MRI today. The neurologist says hes fairly confident she isnt having seizures but wants to cover everything.I hope one or both of those things gives us an answer but in the mean time all I have to do is think. What could possibly have caused this loss of vision seemingly overnight? She responds to sounds but not objects. Shes had hundreds of lights (from nurses doctors etc) flashed right in her eyes and she does nothing like youd expect. They shined a light in my eyes to show me how abnormal it was that she did nothing because I instinctively moved my eyes.Also... no falls, no high fevers, no recent illness, her birth was normal, shes developmentally normal.Does anyone have any idea of what this could be?","output":"Sorry to hear about your daughter. It is hard to know the cause without all the test results at the current time, especially the MRI, as this seems to be something less common. If she looks well in other aspects (except for the vision loss), and has already been evaluated by a pediatrician, ophthalmologist, and a pediatric neurologist, you are doing everything you can, and it seems that everything necessary is being done. Vision requires normal eyes, normal optic nerves connecting the eyes to the brain, and normal function of the visual cortex of the brain, and of course normal response to vision requires good function of the rest of the brain. Generally most problems affecting the eyes affect only one eye at a time, and can be seen by the ophthalmologist (either anterior chamber problems such as cataracts or posterior chamber issues such as retinoblastoma). Problems affecting the optic nerves (e.g optic neuritis) are more often seen in older kids (e.g with multiple sclerosis) and are very rare at 15 months. Rarely, there can be problems near where the optic nerves come together just behind the eyes (optic chiasma) when masses (eg. craniopharyngioma)/cysts push on them and can cause visual loss. It is also rare for things to affect the visual cortex of the brain. I suspect that the MRI will be of help. If it does find something, it might need other specialists (e.g. neurosurgeon) to provide further information on management."}
{"input":"2 year old admitted to hospital, unresponsiveLatest update (since coming back to the US after private hospital was unable to treat him in February, and he was having retractions): For future parents that might be in a similar situation and trying to find answers, I thought I would share what we have learned since coming back to the US.While in the hospital, the doctor kept saying he was unconscious because of inflammation. However, as I was trying to gather medical information, his theory at the time was sepsis. He did have a UTI a month or two earlier that we struggled to find antibiotics to treat (although he seemed to respond well and quickly when our pediatrician prescribed Augmentin).Our pediatrician here suspects encephalitis because he was fully up to date on vaccines (including pneumococcal), and the timeline was so fast from a cold to eyes fluttering open but not responding to pain or voices. Hopefully we will never know, because the most likely way to be able to correctly diagnose what happened is that it happens again while in an area with better ability to treat and test.That being said, information that would have been nice to have included a blood culture and a brain scan (according to our pediatrician here). Our pediatrician at the hospital where he was admitted did not have the ability to do either of these, and I still think it was our best option, but I wish I had known that the hospital was so limited because I wish I had at least had the opportunity to consider medical evacuation. I truly believe his pediatrician at the time was doing the best he could, and quite frankly, I still completely believe he saved his life, but I have learned that there are cultural differences. Doctors in some cultures may not be as forthcoming as would be expected in Europe and the US.Although to say, he is fine now. Because of the mystery surrounding the diagnosis in December, we don't really know how likely another similar episode is. However, now he seems like a perfectly healthy, developmental normal, energetic and talkative 2 year old boy! And we have learned to ask A LOT more questions about medical care before moving overseas ;)Update: His primary care just came in. He believes it is a combination of factors. Firstly, he is fighting a virus. Secondly, his glucose level was low and he was dehydrated at admission. He anticipates sending us home maybe tomorrow. For right now, he said he just needs IV nutrition and fluids, and time for his body to kick whatever the virus is that he's fighting.My son, 2 year old male, 12 kg, 85 cm, was admitted to the hospital about 9 hours ago. Our whole family has had a virus. Both he and my daughter received IV nutrition day 36 hours ago. My daughter recovered yesterday almost completely, but my son slept all day. I think it's been several days since he stood on his own. I brought him to the hospital, anticipating needing another round of saline, vitamins, and glucose.As I was transporting him, though, it became apparent that he was even sicker than I realized. He was completely limp, and failed to respond in any way to checking his glucose levels. His eyes would flutter open and sometimes hed briefly make eye contact, but he didn't respond to his name.He has been admitted at least overnight. His glucose and electrolytes were low, as well his leukocytes. One of his liver enzymes was also high (I believe AST...whichever one, it was 42). His urinalysis came back with ammonium urate, mucus, and acetone (according to Google Translate...I am a beginner in the language here, and the doctors and nurses don't speak English, so everything I know is through Google Translate). His O2 was also a little low (94), so he is on oxygen. They have given him glucose and electrolytes and vitamins, as well as an antibiotic.Can anyone explain why he became unresponsive? His BMI was perfectly healthy. I thought fat was able to sustain through sickness like this until able to eat again, and not only that, he had IVs yesterday of vitamins, saline, and glucose. Is he going to be ok? How long is the road to recovery likely going to last? Any theories as to what's going on?I'll also attach a copy of the urinalysis, translated. I don't have a copy of the blood work, though.Edited to add: He has since woken up for brief periods. Maybe 4 hours or so on IVs, he woke up and asked to nurse. He also fought the nurse and doctor while having his nose aspirated... the doctor, nurse, and I all had to hold him. He fell asleep shortly after that, and has not woken up since.","output":"There's not nearly enough info to say why he's unresponsive. I know youre stressed and looking for answers but you won't find them here."}

{"input":"37F, 5'7, 128lbs, Caucasian. Primary complaint is increased resting heart rate, palpitations at night that wake me as I'm trying to fall asleep and fatigue.Symptoms started 06/15/2022 with one severe episode of diarrhea. After that I was feeling very fatigued. On 06/22/2022 I was very dizzy and almost fainted, my heart rate was elevated (120-140) and I had tingling/numbness in my hands and feet. Went to the ED. Only thing they found was a Potassium of 2.6, they said my ECG was \"inline with my low Potassium\". They gave me IV Potassium, Magnesium and saline. Got my Potassium up to 3.8 and sent me home.Three days later I had a similar episode and went back to the ER (I thought maybe my Potassium was low again or that maybe it was my heart). They did another ECG and said my heart was fine. Potassium was fine. No other abnormalities. ER doc said maybe viral or Thyroid.In the weeks after my ER visit I was still feeling very weak and my heart rate was still elevated (80's laying, 90's sitting, 110 standing). I was still dizzy. My stomach was destroyed, I couldn't eat without getting severe reflux and I just wasn't hungry. I thought it could be POTS. My symptoms were worse in the morning and in the evenings I felt almost normal.Symptoms slowly started to improve as I started breathing/meditation exercises and started getting back into training and eating. (I lost almost 10 pounds during this because I just couldn't eat).I then started to experience adrenaline surges where my heart would race, I would feel very jittery, nauseous and I would have to pee many times. At first the surges happened only in the morning, but later started happening at night. Only one a day. The surges would leave me very tired. I had very poor exercise tolerance.I saw my PCP and we ran many tests, CBC, BMP, Full Thyroid Panel, T3 and antibodies, H.Pylori, AM cortisol, Catecholamines, PTH, Heavy metals, MTHFR, DHEA serum, ACTH plasma, celiac panel, Homocysteine, CRP, 25 hour Urine Catecholamines and Metanephrines, Folate RBC and serum and B12. The only \"abnormal\" tests are below:Alkaline Phosphatase low 32 (this has always been low for me).High epinephrine 67 (I was having a \"surge\" that morning, I am not afraid of blood draws).Heterozygous C665C MTHFRHigh am Cortisol 21.2 (I was having a \"surge\" that morning, I am not afraid of blood draws).DHEA 686 (she said it was normal but it seems high for me based on my age).24 hour urine Normetanephrine 122 lowFolate RBC 1248 (for context)Folate serum >20 (for context)B12 852 (for context)Background information: When this all started, my husband and I were trying to conceive and I had been taking 800mcg of Methylfolate to prevent neural tube defects since May. The day I ended up in the ER was the day I got my period. I thought that maybe, based on my MTHFR mutation, I had a bad reaction/poor tolerance to the Methylfolate so I stopped taking it 2 weeks ago. My symptoms seemed to align with too much Methylfolate, based on other peoples reports.My biggest complaint now is the palpitations at night. I keep getting jolted awake several times as I am falling asleep. This lasts an hour until I fall asleep until morning. Palpitations are felt when I am lying on my side and sometimes when I lie flat on my back. I have headaches off and on and still feel like something isn't right, like my body cannot relax. I also get this feeling of pressure in my head. I don't have any shortness of breath except for when I am jolted awake at night.I am not an anxious person thought I am certain these issues have caused worries. I am active (strength training three times a week, assault bike workouts and lots of walking/hiking/paddleboarding). I do Olympic lifting for fun but haven't gotten back to that yet. I eat paleo-ish, low carb, Weston A. Price though I am trying to incorporate more carbs into my diet. I take Magnesium Glycinate at night, probiotics, Vitamin D and Cod Liver Oil. I practice good sleep hygiene. I don't lead a stressful life. I have a cardiology appointment at the end of August.Any input would be greatly appreciated as I have already spent so much money on all this, I need to be efficient with my resources.Im thinking that something really messed me up, maybe the Methylfolate combined with a stomach bug? I had COVID in January, maybe that has something to do with it. Will this likely resolve on its own?Thanks in advance!","output":"I dont think methyl folate has anything to do with your symptoms. My hypothesis is that the first occurrence sensitised you and made you more introspective. Fear of something can cause tachycardia and introspection can make you notice your heart beat, where you previously wouldnt have noticed it.Relaxation exercises, especially breathing exercises and a distraction from your own thoughts via audio book or podcast might be helpful. 24h ECG could objectify your symptoms, but Im not sure thats a good idea. Maybe try it for a week or so and get back to me, if it doesnt help? Cant promise Ill immediately respond, but I check up on Reddit regularly :)"}

{"input":"51F (pulmonary) under what circumstances should I take mom to the ER? She has chronic respiratory failure - hypoxia of unknown origin being worked up - but over past 3 days she's gotten worse51F, 59, very thin, getting thinner fast, white, USA. non-smoker, non-drinker; no prescriptions. On supplemental oxygen for chronic respiratory failure - hypoxia. Undergoing workup to figure out whats wrong but its taking taking forever. (This is for my mom.) (x-post)Very long story short: formerly vibrantly healthy moms been deteriorating since January. Shes lost over 25lbs since then, has been having daily oxygen desaturations down to as low as 80 whenever she started walking for months and is now on supplemental oxygen. Exhaustive pulmonary testing (including RHC and shunt studies) and cardiac testing (echo with bubble study) all inexplicably normal. The doctors are puzzled, as you can imagine. She looks awful. She does have a few \"good\" hours in the morning, but it slowly diminished til afternoons she crashed. As of now, \"good\" morning hours aren't lasting as long and she's crashing earlier in the day when she hits a wall, becomes totally sapped of energy, becomes very weak.At first her oxygen only went down when she was up and about and moving, down as low as 80, thats when she got the order for supplemental oxygen. But past 3 days, it's going down much more often, even at rest. (But it IS intermittent, not constant.)Heres why Im here today seeking advice: What would be a scenario that would mean we should take her to the ER? As of the past 3 days shes feeling worse, now has oxygen desats at rest, and it also is dipping down more and more often than ever before, and something very new - her heart rate keeps dipping a few times a day down into the 50s and occasional 40s (not necessarily when her oxygen is low - sometimes yes thats the case, sometimes when shes on oxygen it happens too. In the past few evenings shes been having severe shortness of breath even when her oxygen is at 100. Although shes been ill for months w/no answers yet, these worsening signs and symptoms have only been happening for about 3 days.Blessed to live in a city with a nationally known excellent medical center. The head of one of the lung hospital lung centers shes been seeing wants her to come back in to see him again for further investigation since the last study (shunt) was normal and they still dont know whats wrong (what the hell else can they test for???), but that conversation with him was last Thursday, before things suddenly got even worse on Friday til now - and who knows when that appt will happen. He's in high demand of course.In the meantime were in a holding pattern, so please can someone give advice on if there are certain signs or symptoms that would trigger us to take her to the ER?","output":"The desaturations at rest are concerning, it would be reasonable to take her into the emergency room now. Given your post it seems that she would have very poor reserves, so if things worsen even a little bit she may have profound effects.Another option is to get ahold of her pulmonologist or the person whom is on call for the clinic. He/she would be able to give a more informed opinion based on her unique situation."}
{"input":"79M approx.. 6 195 lbs. asthma (we have no idea what meds he is on or prescribed at ER)My FIL (79M) was taken via ambulance to a small local community hospital on Tuesday and diagnosed in the ER with having had a TIA due to Afib. Heart issues is something that was unknown to them previously so he was not previously on any meds for that. My husband got up there in time to interact with the doctor at discharge and specifically heard the doctor tell FIL and MIL that he needed to take the meds he was being prescribed and see cardiology and neurology as soon as possible. This was a small local community hospital outside of San Diego but they are in an area with a large senior population where they probably see this a lot. My husband felt the instructions were clear and relayed succinctly.Because my own father has a long and fantastic experience with both cardiology and neurology at the large very well respected university medical center my husband asked me if I could make appointments for his father there as we figured inlaws were overwhelmed among other issues. I was surprisingly able to secure him appointments for this Monday and Tuesday respectively (6 days post ER visit). Husband told MIL that evening that appointments were secured for FIL at the university hospital.Now today my husband learns that MIL took FIL to their GP yesterday (day after he was released and before specialist visits) to their GP (whom my husband refers to as Dr. Quack due to his negligent care of his aunt resulting in her subsequent death due to melanoma so we may be biased here and this is why we are asking) told him he didnt need coumadin that he was just stressed and he just needed some Xanax to relax. So FIL told my husband today that he stopped the meds that ER doc overprescribed and am just taking the Xanax. I FEEL GREAT! FTR we have no idea what the other meds were and now they wont tell us.MIL is exploding at my husband and accusing him of a lot of wildly ridiculous things and FIL is trying to keep the peace and just shutting down. As a bit of background there are A LOT of issues with MIL and her behavior and this is pretty standard. Husbands basic rule is that we just need to prevent her from harming others and just tune her out otherwise. So our question is will this change of meds harm FIL and husband needs to intervene more strongly or is this something standard? TIATLDR: is it medically acceptable for a GP to remove someone from blood thinner (Coumadin?) less than 48 hours after a TIA and replace with Xanax even before they have seen cardiology or neurology?Edited to clarify timing","output":"Everything here is just odd.

What started out as a chronic cough and getting fevers and flu like symptoms were passed off as Covid towards the end of 2020.Then as the months went by it was passed off that she was getting sick at school. Various antibiotics and not getting better.Then in mid 2021 it was passed off as chronic sinusitus and told to use saline solution and more antibiotics.Then a few months later it was allergies and to take Claritin.Then after seeing the allergist it was Asthma because after 60pt test she's not allergic to anything but clearly decrease in breathing capacity so Albuterol.After seeing the cardiologist it was lower respiratory and take Symbicort with Claritin and Albuterol.After seeing ENT it was adnoids. After adnoidectomy she is to keep taking all of the above as well.Here we are two months later my daughter is home from school coughing just as she did two years ago. I have given her antacids and childrens pepto, along with pre+probiotics (largely because of the antibiotics) including all of the above mentioned medicine, and while she's no longer getting the flu-like symptoms she coughs so much she doesn't even realize she's doing it anymore.

She has a panic disorder thats especially bad in medical settingse.g., took 0.5mg Xanax before their recent echocardiogram, but was still hyperventilating and crying throughout.Three weeks ago she was having some chest tightness, which we thought was from a workout we did the prior day, but wanted to go to urgent care just in case. Urgent care gave her an EKG (her first one), which had an inverted T wave in one lead (EditI think it was actually in two leads, EKG reveals sinus tachycardia at a rate of 117, T wave inversions inferiorly and laterally.). Along with the tachycardia (which always happens in medical offices, but goes back down to ~70bpm after) and they sent us (in our car, not ambulance) to the ER.ER did blood panel CBC/diff, some hormones, D-dimer in case clot, etc, all looked normal except for neutrophils at 82% (reference 48-76), then checked for fluid in the heart cavity with an ultrasound. ER wasnt concerned and sent us home with a cardiology f/u.Cardiology NP was worried about potential inflammation (e.g. myocarditis, as Ive heard has been a more common than usual in young women lately from covid, which we dont think weve had yet) so did an echo and a few more blood tests, including a sediment test, all of which looked normal.No chest pain or tightness or swelling other complaints since the ER incident.I dont have the full EKG, but herere the values they released to us from one lead:PR interval: 123ms QRS: 78ms QT: 318ms QTC: 443ms P Axis: 65 degrees R Axis: 69 degrees T Axis: -4 axis (was -36 at previous visit)Cardiology NP is concerned about the inverted T wave and wanted a cardiac MRI after the echocardiogram, but to me the T wave seems like an unconcerning variation in the absence of other symptoms. If I was the patient Id be fine with the MRI but, given how psychologically difficult an MRI would be for my spouse, Im not sure its necessary and want to encourage her to talk to her primary care doctor about her options.Based on the (of course incomplete) picture Im giving here, does my interpretation sound reasonable, or am I missing something?Thank you!","output":"Inverted T-waves in V1 and V2 are normal."}

{"input":"Any pediatric GIs who are familiar with intussusception? Or something that presents as such symptomatically?Any pediatric GIs who are familiar with intussusception?My 15month old son who was full term at birth was diagnosed with a small bowel intussusception when my husband and I brought him to the emergency room yesterday, 12/21/2022. The ultrasound report read, There is a 1.1 x 0.9 cm small bowel small bowel intussusception in the left hemiabdomen near the umbilicus. No evidence of ileocolic intussusception in the right lower quadrant. No free fluid in the abdomen or pelvis.After this was found on ultrasound, after 2 hours, an ultrasound was repeated, and the intussusception was gone.I have to say I wasnt surprised by this diagnosis, and I am GLAD that it was found on ultrasound.Since my son was six weeks old, he has experienced what I intuitively thought was GI distress. He would scream inconsolably, turn red in the face, and grunt as if he were trying to bear down. This wasnt infrequent; it was all happening all the time. Every week we would visit the pediatrician and an urgent care 1-3 times. At these visits, they would tell my husband and me that it was colic or gas or fussiness. We tried different formulas with cutting everything out of my diet because he was getting breastmilk too. We tried gas drops, bicycles, probiotics, and the colic holds we were shown. You name it; we tried it.After six months of torture for my little guy, I finally said ENOUGH was ENOUGH, and I brought him to the emergency room. The imaging at the emergency room showed that he had a lot of gas in his abdomen, and it was recommended that we try a hypoallergenic formula. (Before this, my son was getting breastmilk supplemented with formula.) We switched to Similac alimentum. Once we discovered that all of the formula we had given our little guy was recalled, we changed to Nutramigen. Since being on the hypoallergenic formula, the CONSTANT crying and screaming had subsided but hadnt completely gone away.He would have bouts of inconsolable screaming that would last 20 minutes, and then he would calm down. Sometimes he would have bouts of screaming that would last 20 minutes, calm, and then crescendo into more extended periods of crying with bearing down, turning red in the face, shaking, and vomiting.With that said, I am looking for some guidance. Has any pediatric GI seen or heard of small bowel intussusception reoccurring for this time? The Emergency Room doctor said he couldnt answer this question because he sees the acute visit of patients. He recommended that we follow up with a pediatric GI surgeon and our pediatrician.I spoke with the pediatric GI Nurse Practitioner, and she said they do not perform surgeries on small bowl intussusceptions. She said that they only perform surgeries on small to large bowl intussusceptions. She also said that this should subside when he is 5 -- she said this as if I could look forward to relief for him in 3 1/2 years!!The pediatric GI Nurse Practitioner and the Emergency Room Physician told me that I should bring him to the ED anytime he presented the way he did when I brought him in when he was diagnosed. This cant is the answer. This is not sustainable for us or our child. Since he was 15 months old, we have brought him into the ED, pediatricians office, and urgent care countless times for the same issues. It just so happens that they FOUND the cause THIS time.I would like to know if anyone has guidance or familiarity with this. Some questions I have are, has anyone ever seen a re-occurring intussusception? If this is re-occurring, is our only option to keep bringing him to the ED? Could something else be missing? Who else should I talk to? What else should I do?I am so frustrated with all the conflicting information and advice I have been given over the last 15 months. I feel so discouraged and not heard.I am so worried and heartbroken seeing my son constantly go through this.Any suggestions would be helpful. I am following up with our pediatrician, and hopefully, they will FINALLY put in a referral to a pediatric GI. I am a registered nurse, so I have a general background in the medical field.","output":"Transient small bowel intuss is a common finding in kids with belly pain or GI distress.No, it essentially never needs intervention.Kids get it all the time when they have stomach bugs. You just don't have an ultrasound on their belly the whole time.This may or may not be related to his prior issues of belly pain at all.A possible, but unlikely possibility is some sort of pathologic lead point that causes recurrent intuss. Like a Mekels, a real bad Peyer's patch, vascular anomaly, or even less commonly malignancy. I know of these being implicated more so for recurrent ileocecal intuss, but I suppose there's no reason they can't occur higher up.I think referral to peds GI is appropriate.Another possibility is Deitls crisis. It's recurrent, transient UPJ obstruction that causes episodes of pain, similar to intuss. It's rare, but also underdiagnosed, because nobody fucking knows about it. Small kids that have it are actually experiencing renal colic, but can't communicate it, and are presumed to have actually have abdominal pain. It's something to consider in the child with chronic episodic belly pain that self resolves and has no other symptoms."}

Ended up going to Hawaii where she thought she actually had covid there and those were also negative. She was complaining of the same thing. At one point, thought it was sun poisoning. Shes seemed to get worse and worse. A week later, which was 2 days after returning home she went to the ER for what she thought was severe dehydration. It wasnt that but they werent sure what it was. Said to see her pcp.ER doc did a handful of labs. Initially told her to see her pcp for follow up labs for mono or leukemia. Her joints ache, a weird floaty face feeling, no fever, no upper respiratory, majority of joint pain is in her legs and toes feel strange. Headaches here and there. Otherwise, she feels okay. No notice of brushing, bloody noses, rapid weight loss.Labs below. If a number is in here more than once its because it was the second lab test when increased.

I have had these symptoms for the past two years or so, but my rash has spread onto my hands and the swollen lymph node will not go down - it doesn't hurt but I do notice it in my arm pit and it is visual when I raise my arm. I went to the doctor, since all my complaints were kind of general and vague she ran an ANA - positive 1:160, speckled. I was sent to Rheumatology, the Rheumatologist checked for Lupus, said I do not look like a typical Lupus pt and all my other Rheum bloodwork was normal (ESR CRP etc). He explained healthy people have positive ANAs. He did want me to go to Dermatology for the rash. He didn't think it looked like Lupus but did say it looked suspicious. He agreed that something was wrong with me as he believes skin is a big indicator in overall health. I went to my original doctor to get a referral to Dermatology - she decided to run an allergy panel and refer me at the same time so the Dermatologist would have everything in my chart they may need. Everything was completely normal, no allergies at all except my igE was at 3 which she flagged as low on my chart, even though the reference said 2.5 was low.After looking low igE up, I am not a doctor so I obviously do not understand a lot of the terminology, but from what I can gather it seems that people with autoimmune conditions usually have a low igE. Not that it is not necessarily a diagnosing factor for anything, but that the two usually go hand in hand *from what I can understand.*My question is: should I request a full immunoglobulin panel? Does having a low igE warrant that? I wanted to touch base with my doctor about the igE but did not want to ask her for an unnecessary bloodwork if igE doesn't correlate with an immunoglobulin panel - if that makes any sense? lol.I have read about CVID and would like to rule this out in my medical journey.Hopefully this all makes sense!

{"input":"F49, 55, 143 lbsI had a severe allergic reaction and I almost died on Tuesday. I got stung 2-3 times by a yellow jacket while cutting the grass. I came inside to get some Benadryl and saw all these black spots (probably 4 minutes later). Then I was profusely diaphoretic, dry heaves, had copious amount of phlegm from my mouth and nose, couldnt breathe, weakness and was blacking out. It was so so fast.My husband (hero #1) happened to be coming from the airport so he called 911 and My 13 year old gave me one of her epipens in the thigh (she is anaphylactic to shellfish and buckwheat). First responders came (maybe 4.5 minutes) and I couldnt open my eyes, they put me on a blood pressure monitor and then it was alarming, so they turned the alarm off. Then advanced life support I think or Ems literally picked me up and ran me out to the ambulance. I think I blacked out and woke up and I barely remember the ambulance ride with sirens and lights and them laying on the horn. I could hear them saying we got gotta get her pressure up, we got nothing here. I remember trying to talk to them and my tongue wouldn't work. When I was conscious and realized the lights and sirens were on, i saw the seriousness. When I heard them say ETA 3-5 and BP of 40/20 - I 'm like , that's not compatible with life. The paramedics worked on me the entire time. At hospital had me in a trauma room and called all staff over loudspeaker. Thankfully they got my pressure up and gave me another epipen and steroids and Benadryl. The epipen and lack of blood flow gave me some cardiac issues and Im following up with cardiology.That said, I dont feel right. Im weak. I keep waking up with nightmares about not being able to breathe and I keep replaying the incident in my head. I have little appetite. Do you think I would benefit from some counseling? Did I almost die? I feel like I certainly came close. Would I be a candidate for venom therapy? I feel like this if my only chance at a normal life.Is there any way I have some sort of Mast Cell Disorder for this to come on so suddenly?","output":"Sounds like a pretty traumatic experience and I'm sorry you had to go through that. It is normal not to feel completely yourself this quickly after such an event, and it may take some time to feel back to normal again.Medically, it is good that you have recovered. I must emphasize you need to have an epi-pen with you at all times in the event you do have another sting at some point. The strength will come back. It's hard to tell how bad off you are, but can say a BP of 40/20 is pretty bad.Counseling is up to you. It sounds like you are having an acute stress reaction to a traumatic experience (think PTSD, but happening essentially immediately after). This may improve on its own, or may need some help to get through."}
{"input":"Flu-like ache but definitely not the flu. Could it be linked to a nutritional deficiency?32 F.Height 5' 11. Weight 145lbs.Vegan diet, health-conscious, mildly-moderately active.I've basically had fatigue and consistent mild pain since I was a teenager (my doctor put it down to depression). But this has continued into adulthood and I'm becoming determined to get to the bottom of it.But for the past couple of weeks I've been having this really weird sensation of a deep ache and tightness throughout my body, like it's in my bones and my joints. The closest thing I can describe it as is that it's similar to when you have body aches with the flu, but not nearly that bad. It's quite mild, but I feel like I can feel it throughout my chest/back/ribs, in my arms and hands, and occasionally in my legs. It's not debilitating, it's just weird and a little uncomfortable. It's not consistent either, it sort of comes in little waves/pulses. I get a deep pain in my leg bones sometimes when the weather is very hot or very cold, and it's a similar ache to that but again not as severe, just a similar 'deep'ness.Have you heard of this before?!I'm looking into getting some tests done to see if I have a chronic deficiency. Last time I was tested I was told I don't have anaemia, but I'm also interested in vitamin B12 and D deficiencies. Also considering getting the genetic sequencing test to look for MTHFR mutation, because from my own research it seems that a lot of my symptoms link up with this.Is there anything else I should get tested for?I typically eat a very healthy, balanced diet. I get plenty of protein, supplement with a good quality B12, take vitamin D drops in winter, occasionally take Floradix for iron if I know I haven't eaten much iron that day. Occasionally I take K2 and hemp seed oil for omega 3-6-9.","output":"With vague non-specific body aches like that, a doctor can help elucidate a more thorough and specific history and exam. Not sure how long ago the last set of labs were and what exactly the hemoglobin and MCV values were, Id start with repeating routine labs like CBC and CMP, maybe a CK to check for muscle breakdown. TSH and vitamin D levels would not be unreasonable. The presence or lack of anemia on repeat testing can guide whether or not a B12 or homocysteine should be checked. Not sure why one would bypass these cheaper and possibly indicated tests for an expensive test for a gene variant that wouldnt change management without starting with routine labs and going from there.If one were truly concerned about malabsorption from diet, then consider celiacs testing and ruling out IBD if there are other GI issues."}

{"input":"Hello Reddit,My younger brother was 27, Male, maybe 6 foot and 375 pounds, half white/asian, no drugs, no smoking, extremely rarely drinking (like less than once a month).I don't recall what his early symptoms were but I found a virtual chat that said he may of had \"uncomplicated cystitis\" and had antibiotics prescribed for it. He saw a urologist and eventually had a nephrostomy tube, then had surgery later and was noted with a failed kidney. They were unable to remove it due to his weight and having hemorrhage concerns, at least that was my understanding, and that's it for a his existing medical condition, with an exception.I'm first wondering how he developed this condition to begin with. Would the failed kidney have caused the infection? I wish I had the full records so I could paint a better picture, but ultimately I can only guess that his high blood pressure was a cause, plus having a high stress job.Ever since all this, he had to urinate every like hour and this caused issues with work and sleep. I really don't understand why this kept happening and nothing was given to him for it. Would having a failed kidney cause that? This started back at the end of 2020 and the tube and surgery may have been in Q2/3? I now can't remember what happened first.From that I'm mostly wondering about the reason for frequent urination and if he would have got infected some other way outside of high blood pressure. He almost never leaves the house, and I fear he'd only get sick if a family member came home with something.Fast forward to the bulk of my reason to post. On January 13, 2023 he mentioned some nasal congestion and some body aches. He didn't seem to get better on the 14th so I asked if he wanted to see a doctor and he said not yet. This eventually came with some headaches so we tried to go to an urgent care but the wait times were 3+ hours so we figured try a Teladoc (98point6 for this call) and get an appointment later. He mentions a head ache lasting 4-5 days, dull/sharp pains in waves from front to back, also going behind his eyes. He was taking ibuprofen, and was asked about a fever and he said he wasn't sure but his head seems warmer compared to his body. They basically said to take Afrin and Excedrin and go to urgent care if things don't get better. When he went to take the afrin that night, he blew his nose and had a nose bleed, and per our father he had nose bleeds from time to time, but not that super often.Come January 19 I take him to urgent care and I do have his visit summary. Blood pressure 174/89 (why the fuck didn't anyone talk about this), temporal temperature of 98.1 (maybe the medication lowered it?), pulse 90, respiration 18, oxygen saturation 97. They gave him Toradol and sent him home. I feel like a fucking asshole that I wasn't in there with him, I had to drop him off and attend a work meeting that I should of canceled, and our mother picked him up. This is all very local, like within 15 minute drives.He doesn't seem to get better and on the 22nd he talks about some vision issues so I immediately take him to the nearest ER, which is a satellite and not attached to a large hospital. He goes to a back room almost immediately after checking in - alone, and again I feel like a fucking loser as I should of gone there with him to help explain everything - who knows exactly what he said since he was dealing with headaches. I did come back and talk to one of the nurses, but that didn't seem to change anything they expected.He had the following lab tests done, CBC With Diff, CG4 PANEL POC, Comprehensive Metabolic Panel Poc, PCR Influenza A & B and Covid 19 (POCT). Also had a CT Head W/O Contrast and EKG. Done today was just the CG4 and Comprehensive Metabolic, guess the CBC was still processing? I don't recall any notes on this, and his MyChart is closed.They didn't seem to find anything, even though he had a 171/105 blood pressure, they did ask if he had history and I didn't have a full answer, but said it wouldn't be surprising since the rest of the family has medication for it, but he didn't have a primary care doctor to prescribe it. He had trouble finding one since COVID and it really pisses me off that I didn't help him find one somehow. He also had 100.1 temperature.They gave him .9% NaCl (NS), tylenol, benadryl, toradol and reglan, and sent him home.The next day I don't remember exactly what triggered this, maybe balance, but we took him to the ER attached to the hospital and the doctor almost immediately said he wasn't going home that night, he saw something. They put him in a gown and my brother was shivering mad, and he normally likes it cold. Sometime that night I believe he got a room and had some tests, and they said he had meningitis, and shortly after was uncertain of contagious so the room was adjusted and we had to wear N95 masks and a face shield / gown. This went for maybe 2-3 days, and it bothers me so much because this was the most critical time that I could of had talking to my brother and I minimized my time like a coward and asshole. I believe our mother was there the whole time though.After that 2-3 days it was cleared for bacterial and said likely viral (they never said what he had) and the additional PPE was stopped. I remember he texted me to bring apple juice, yogurt, and fruit cups, which I did, but asked if it was okay because I thought hospitals didn't want outside food. They said it was okay as long as it conformed to a low sodium diet, which those did.During this I know he had a lumbar puncture, which is likely how they found the meningitis, and had a CT/MRI that they said was clear. Then suddenly the next day he developed delirium. He was able to answer our questions and knew who we were, but it was like he was living in a video game or something. He'd also spring up very quickly pulling wires to urinate (and frequently) which caused concerns for the monitoring and fall prevention, since he was a little wobbly and I think bumped his side one day because of the bar being down for the accessibility access for the toilet.The doctors believed the delirium was due to his lowered sodium levels, which could have been to the frequent urination and low sodium diet. He was drinking a ton of Gatorade at home back home, probably around the 16th I was buying him multi-packs as I felt those helped me recover. Eventually they put him on a EEG and because of the frequent getting up and sometimes he'd just try to rip the things off, they restrained him. I wasn't there when it happened but our mom was there and it sounded a little traumatic, like saying \"why are you doing this mommy, and then attempting to bite her\". Not sure if that's exactly what happened but he was restrained. Either at that point or shortly after he did have a nurse assigned to be next to him 24/7 to monitor, and help him pee as he'd be responsive if he had to go and the nurses asked.During this delirium he'd talk about random stuff, sounded like he was in a game, he couldn't explain where he was, but he was still answering questions. Everyday I visited I'd ask if he knew who I was and he'd start by laughing and saying of course, and I had to be more specific with him and he'd confirm my name and that I'm his brother. During this time we had a family member with him 24/7, but would occasionally talk to him, I know I'd hold his hand and he'd squeeze back, but we'd end up sitting to the side talking to each or reading a book, etc.Finally on the 30th I was coming in to swap out with our father, who said that my brother was a bit quieter today, maybe he was finally getting some much needed sleep as it seemed like he wasn't getting any. I also noticed that he had an oxygen tube under his nose, which wasn't there before. I didn't want to wake him so I didn't do much, and this was the first day I decided to pop up my switch and play some yoshi crafted world, and I kept one ear bud out just in case.I know he had a lumbar puncture done either before I came or just as I came, and an MRI earlier (might have been the previous day, it's becoming a blur now and I hate it) and the neurologist said they see a lesion, and it looked like one of the quadrants of the brain. I honestly can't remember but it felt like a sizable portion. I also looked at the EEG from time to time as I assume they were looking for seizures and I swear I saw alerts on the machine detecting them.This was the first time that I was going to pull the all nighter, and it was normally our mother that would do that and I offered to stay but she wanted to get some rest which I understood. A bit after I was there I noticed they swapped the tube with an oxygen mask, and I regret to this day that I did not look at that monitor better, seeing if oxygen was dropping, etc. There was a nurse there but I don't know how well they were watching, I swear one of the guys before was on his phone most of the time. I remember there was a night shift change, and I don't recall how long after before the most traumatic part happens. I did ask if my brother snored normally to our parents, as I never really heard him sleep and our father said yes, and he should get a sleep study done. It reminded me of our father's sleep apnea when napping on the couch during movie night. I don't remember how long this went on for, but I think they adjusted the bed height or something, don't remember... yet another thing to add to my list of regrets.That night after playing a bit I remember my arms getting tired so I pulled the little side table near me to prop my switch up on so I could just use the remotes, and all of a sudden a bunch of nurses come rushing into the room and one of the nurses checks his neck and says no pulse, then a code blue is called. I am escorted out of the room and just panicking. I don't remember hearing the monitor beeping prior (remember 1 ear bud and I had the volume at like 1 tick), and I don't recall him snoring just before either. For all I know the sensors were faulted and he was out for awhile, I have no idea how immediate it was, or if maybe the table pulled/squeezed the oxygen tube (this all happened in like 10 seconds). I know that his monitor was beeping a lot earlier due to his blood pressure, and I don't know if they gave him medication, but I don't remember that monitor beeping at all that day. Maybe the last nurse silenced it? I don't know. I also don't know how well the nurse was watching. One of the nurses in the morning/afternoon was great and I know she was looking at his face and the monitor with great focus, and I fear the night nurses not so much. I know the nurse that night was from newborns, and just helping out.I don't understand why or how he code blued, how quick it was, or anything, but I know it took them over 20 minutes to bring him back and he was on a ventilator. They did the 24 hour thermal treatment of going cold then normal, and after that for the next few days they'd do an eye test and pain test with no responses. On February 1 they did some test with a dye to see blood movement in the brain and I saw the results that night saying there was little blood flow but not clinically brain dead. I had a spark of hope but knew I wasn't a doctor. The next day we talked to the neurologist and confirmed that he was indeed brain dead and I felt like I lost my brother for the 3rd time in that hospital. Once during delirium, then the cardiac arrest, and now. We had to decide when to pull the life support, and I watched him officially die, for what felt like the 4th time.Having to find the courage to join our father for the funeral arrangements, then the funeral which was a visitation before cremation, then picking up the urn a week later, it's been waves of trauma and it still feels like yesterday a month later. Everyday I've gone home to see my parents, and touch the urn and cry. I don't understand why he's in there and not at our house playing video games with his friends.I don't understand how he got sick to begin with, he moved in with me back in May and I tried to make things as comfortable for him as possible. This was his first winter with me and I think this house is a bit drier than the parents he lived with, but I wouldn't think that'd cause the issue. He almost never leaves, he works from home and plays games. If he caught anything it'd be from me, and I know I got sick at the end of June with COVID and he caught that from me, what a fucking loser I am. I did another trade show in September and got sick, not sure if he got it then, he didn't report time off to work (and he tries to take every time off he can).I don't understand why the teladoc didn't ask other questions, or the urgent care to find anything. Then later the first ER only commented on the high blood pressure, and it wasn't until the second ER that they knew something was up.Why did he get delirium, why did they let sodium levels drop? What was going on with the oxygen? With the monitoring he had, how did they let a cardiac arrest happen?I have so many questions and it pains me knowing that even if I get knew, it doesn't change that my baby brother is gone. We had so many plans this year, such as cooking better for ourselves, working out to lose weight, and most critically spending more time outside of his room to try new things like restaurants and take vacations. The last vacation I had with him was 2007, and he was in Hawaii with the parents in 2008 where I was rejected from going because I didn't have a job after high school.Before his delirium I remember one big ask, which was to get a hug, and that he was ready and wanting to go on adventures with me. I hadn't seen my brother much outside of a quick dinner talk from time to time, and when he moved in I was glad to be bonding with him again, and we didn't even get 1 year. We had so many plans, and the world robbed him of that.During the visitation I played the Halo song \"Never Forget\". He was a big Halo fan and that song always gave me the feels. I hugged his cold body for that entire song, wishing I could give him more.This is a long post and I apologize, I just needed to write, and I wonder if anyone knows what may have caused things. I fear that my lack of knowledge and experience failed to get him to the ER sooner, but it didn't seem like that even helped, they may have just done the same as they did on the first visit and turned him around.I failed to protect you brother, I am so sorry. This world is just not fair and you deserved so much more. You were the nicest person anyone would of met and you made those around you happier. I miss you so much brother, and I love you even more.I will see you again one day.","output":"I'm sorry for your loss.Delirium can be caused by many factors including infections, metabolic imbalances, medications, and underlying medical conditions. In your brother's case, the low sodium levels may have played a role, but it is also possible that there were other contributing factors such as an underlying infection or a reaction to medications.His low sodium could be due to frequent urination, or due to his low sodium diet, or it could be due to an underlying medical condition such as adrenal insufficiency or kidney disease.Don't know about the oxygen - but, changes in oxygen levels can occur due to changes in respiratory function, changes in blood pressure, or changes in heart function.The fact that he was on monitoring does not guarantee that a cardiac arrest could not occur. It is possible that the cardiac arrest was due to an underlying medical condition or a sudden event such as an arrhythmia. But, ultimately I don't know."}

What could be the consequences?Edit: I should also say that I do boxing 2/3 times a week, and bike 10km 5 days a week.","output":"The most likely cause is your alcohol use. Alcohol is a well known cause of macrocytosis.Other possible etiologies include B12 deficiency (worth checking a B12 level but unlikely in your case), hemolytic anemia (very unlikely in your case as your hemoglobin is normal), liver disease, certain bone marrow disorders such as genetic conditions or MDS (those are very unlikely in your case).The macrocytosis itself is not concerning but it does mean that you have significant alcohol use. I would try to cut down.It's helps determine the cause of your anemia (low hemoglobin). You shouldn't worry, but you should follow up with your doctor to go through the next steps to work up your anemia with a high MCV. This is a common thing that has a pretty well trod diagnostic pathway that you and your doctor can work through"}
{"input":"Hey yall My kiddo (3M, approx 42 pounds, 3.5 feet tall) (daily meds are nexium, senna, zyrtec, tenex, atarax, melatonin) got referred to hematology and I'm drawing a blank on what questions to ask. He had a blood smear that had \"abnormal lymphocytes\" and a high level of lymphocytes. He started seeing Immunology a few months ago because he's always had frequent infections and fevers just about daily for most of his life. Immunology doesn't have any diagnosis, but are thinking of referring him to rheumatology. Im just not really sure what questions to ask or what to say really. If there's a better sub for this, please point me in the right direction. Thanks y'all!","output":"Where does it say \"abnormal lymphocytes\"? That's unusual language. \"Atypical\" lymphocytes are seen with viral infections, classically mono. If the blood smear was the reason for referral, I would ask what the results mean. If the answer isn't clear, keep asking until you understand. They will tell you the differential diagnosis for the findings and what additional tests they recommend. There might be none.Frequent infections are the rule in childhood, not some weird immune deficiency. Is he really having fevers every single day for 3 years? Also, one of the most common findings with immune deficiencies is poor growth and your son is a tank :) Rheumatologic conditions in preschoolers often come with poor growth, rash, joint swelling, and very abnormal blood tests. But they can be more subtle and I can't say on the internet if that's a possibility in your case."}
{"input":"Hi all, I'm looking for some assistance for what my next steps are, as I'm just a grad student and not a medical professional.TLDR: 48/F with late stage liver failure and diabetes. Estimated 3-6 months to live. She suddenly is not lucid after stopping most treatment and starting an SSRI. I want to know if this sounds like encephalopathy, and if it does, can it be caused by these treatments?My mom (48/F/caucasian) is currently in the hospital for late stage liver failure. The current prognosis is that 10% is functioning, which is complicated by her diabetes. Last month she was in the hospital with 20% liver function, and had a second toe removed (the first was amputated in 2019).I brought her back in after my dad called complaining about how she can no longer stand, speak coherently, stop crying, and was in constant pain, which we were told was encephalopathy. Since she was removed from the ICU, a family member has been here for the entirety of visitation hours everyday to help her eat, get to the bathroom, etc, so we have witnessed this whole process. After a week or so of treatment with diuretics, she was lucid, starting walking, ate all of her food plus snacks, etc, though still in pain. She was able to verbalize that.Due to the IV teatments they were giving her, she accumulated 40 lbs of fluids in her legs and and abdomen, which they said couldn't drain due to her hemoglobin levels/blood pressure. It started weeping from her legs as a yellow liquid, and eventually she developed dozens of sores on her leg bandages and the legs swelled to 3x their regular size. She was in excruciating pain plus itching, which from what I've read to pretty standard. That all said, she was still able to verbalize this and was lucid.5 days ago, she was told by the hospitalist that there is nothing they can do, and instead of palliative care, she should now be in hospice care. She was incredibly upset by this, but was still lucid. At that time, the palliative care doctor prescribed her an SSRI (not sure which one, they would not tell me) and the hospitalist stopped all other treatment other than blood pressure medicine, insulin before meals, oxycodone upon request, and benedryl for itching upon request.The timeline since then is as follows:Friday, she started receiving the SSRI. She was still lucid, calling people, and complaining of pain.Saturday, she stopped eating, speaking, or drinking anything. She just lays in bed, and if you ask her a question she stares blankly at you. She will nod sometimes to questions. She ate very little, and only when urged to.Sunday, she was about the same. Barely ate and doesn't speak at all.Today, Monday 3/15: she is still the same, and hadn't had any sort of fluid since the previous family member left at 6p the day before and I arrived this morning. She has had no bowel movements in 24 hours. The palliative care representative prescribed ritalin to make her more alert, but it hasn't done anything. We are currently working on transferring her to a hospice care facility.She looks like someone on a heavy dose of oxycodone, but she hasn't had any in days. All she does is stare at us and occasionally eat a piece of candy when prompted. I asked the hospitalist what could cause this so suddenly, but he said there's nothing they can do, as it is not encephalopathy. He referred me to hospice and would give no other information.All of that long background is to say this: this doesn't look like how her encephalopathy manifested before (crying, pain, etc). Is it possible for it show up differently? The only new medication introduced last week was an SSRI, but since she only started it Friday, it seems weird that it would have an immediate effect like that, since I would think that it takes some time for it to get to the liver and metabolize (or not metabolize) and cause a rise in her toxin levels. I have also always been told that it takes weeks for SSRIs to be effective, but I don't know how that changes in cirrhosis patients. If this is not encephalopathy, but what is causing this sudden change?I want to make sure she is receiving proper care, as I'm not able to clean much from her doctors and she is not lucid. Thank you for any guidance on this situation!Here are the papers I read regarding this, in case that is important:2015, Issues in the endstage liver disease patient for which palliative care could be helpful2017, Psychotropic drugs and liver disease: A critical review of pharmacokinetics and liver toxicityNote:I don't know her current numbers, as they messed up her labs this morning and apparently don't redo them when that happens.","output":"I imagine this is one of the toughest times you and your family have ever had to go through. Please don't neglect yourselves whilst looking after your mother and seek appropriate support, particularly psychological, as necessary.I am a psychiatrist, so I will try to answer your query regarding the SSRI. I'm afraid my internal medicine knowledge isn't up to date enough to help with much else here.All SSRIs are hepatically metabolised. They can therefore accumulate over long periods of time, so they must be used cautiously in liver impairment, and SSRIs with long half lives should be avoided. Of the SSRI family, citalopram / escitalopram have the least known effect on hepatic enzymes and are typically the SSRI of choice. Some specialists may prefer paroxetine, due to it having the shortest half life. Whichever is chosen, the general rule is to start low and go slow. I trust your mother's doctors have stuck with this rule. In which case, I suspect there has not been enough time for the new SSRI to accumulate to sufficient levels to be responsible for her acute deterioration, particularly if her deterioration began after just one or two doses.However, even if the SSRI isn't doing any harm, we need to ask ourselves, is it doing her any good? In the state that you have described her to be in, especially since the deterioration, I would struggle to justify continuing the SSRI. At this stage, I would argue the potential harm outweighs the potential benefits. And who knows, I might be wrong about the SSRI not being responsible; if it gets discontinued and your mother starts perking up, then all the better.Sorry to hear about this awful situation, do take care."}

{"input":"Hi so I (23f) have had a sudden onset of joint pain mostly in my hands and arms. It may have been more gradual than I noticed, but this week has been very brutal! Its like my finger joints are just VERY achey and my elbows are also in pain fairly frequently (mostly when my elbows are bent).I work on a computer all day, but am not a typist. I am usually working on excel spreadsheets doing data analysis which I guess I never thought of as typing as its more of a critical thinking thing as my main task. That being said my hands are on a keyboard for the majority of the day.Now my FIL had surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome last year, and it feels like exactly what he described and I am panicking a bit bc I didnt really think that I was a candidate for having this issue so early on in my life! Is it possible that I have carpal tunnel syndrome? What else could it be?Im just scared of the financial ramifications an issue like this may have (Im broke as shit!! But I do have insurance!), but I obviously want to take care of it ASAP instead of letting it get worse. What should my course of action be/how long should I wait before getting it checked out in person?Thanks in advance for your time!ETA: not sure if this is relevant to this issue, but I am in relatively good health. I am overweight but have lost around 50 pounds since the beginning of the year and am well on my way to a healthy weight. I eat mostly cleanly and walk a lot. I used to be an avid weightlifter but have not gotten back into it after a knee injury in 2018 (big part of how I became overweight... lack of movement & depression from losing my job & other stresses due to my injury). I also was a 4 sport athlete in high school: softball, swimming, track & field (discus & shot put), and volleyball. I dont know if any of this is helpful but if it could be a contributing factor I thought I would mention it.","output":"Yes, it's possible for you to have carpal tunnel- it just really depends on your level of activity with hands.You aren't locked into surgery. I'd start with getting an ergonomic setup for yourself and taking frequent breaks from typing. I would also look into getting a wrist brace to sleep with at night, and begin using that for a week or two and seeing if you improve. Chances are if you take early action you won't need surgery for quite some time- if ever."}

Even worse, if you can't private pay or don't have commercial insurance (translation if you have any form of Medicaid) it can be MONTHS waiting for an appointment, and should an 8 year old go without treatment for several months?Just to give you an idea on time frames: my children's my pediatrician started the process to refer my disabled 12yo son to pediatric endocrinology the 3rd week of August.I got the call LAST WEEK to make an appointment for March 2023 in Syracuse. So that's nearly 7 months from start to finish. FWIW our pediatrician doesn't think my son's issue is endocrine related but due diligence, you know?And this isn't new. Had to bring same boy child to Buffalo when he was 6 for ENT and neurologist appointments (well, Rochester was a possibility but I have family in the Buffalo area I can stay with). Same boy also went to Westchester outside of NYC for medical genetics because the waiting list for Syracuse was 2 YEARS LONG the last I asked and the downstate appointment was \"only\" a five month wait. But, family in the area, so worth the trip to see family too.Sorry for the novel. Thank you for being a pediatrician. <3","output":"This is true for an outpatient making a new patient appointment that is not deemed medically urgent by either the referring physician or the office receiving the referral.However, when a patient is seen as a consult in the hospital, they are typically seen in relatively short fashion as a follow up patient by that consulting sub-specialist. (EDIT: for diagnoses that need it. Not for every general admission.)A patient with a new diagnosis of JIA would typically be sent home with a 2 week course of an anti-inflammatory and be seen by the consulting rheumatologist or a colleague within that time period to plan the next phase of treatment. This type of case is not discharged without solidifying the plan for follow up."}
{"input":"I don't, she hadn't uploaded my tests to my portal. She's been my gp for a few years so she knows my conditions etc. The night sweats only cause me to pause because I haven't had them like this since before I quit abusing alcohol. I guess I'm just wondering if I actually need to see a hematologist or if it's something I can try to manage on my own? She ordered a chest x-ray as well, I have no idea what that has to do with any of it!","output":"The Hematologist can at least look at your differential, maybe do a couple tests to rule out uncommon chronic leukemias and similar disorders and give you the all clear so the matter doesnt need to be addressed again. If youve got an appt, may as well go to it at this point. 15 is high enough that we wouldnt resent having to see you hehe. Now if you were sent when it was 12, that would suck, and we get a lot of those referrals as well. Its reasonable to get a once over by a blood doctor for a WBC if 15, but most likely to be fine from that perspective."}
{"input":"I greatly appreciate this response as its extremely informative!The white plaques were never followed up on unfortunately. Her blood in her stool cleared up shortly after so she let it go.I definitely agree with you on the autoimmune thoughts. I had no idea there were so much more to test for. What kind of specialist would she see who would run those kinds of tests and how does she approach it with that doctor? Just tell them she wants to be tested for everything?","output":"A lot of those blood tests I mentioned any primary can order as well as the synovial ultrasound.Its hard to approach an MD about specific tests but I think its worth asking. It just depends on how you think your doctor is. I have patients ask me for specific tests pretty often and we just make a joint decision on if its worth it in shared decision making.As for which specialty? rheumatology and GI would be the ones in my opinion."}
{"input":"I guess one of the possible causes they explored during his first visit was nosebleed due to hypertensive crisis but yeah, it doesn't seem like the doctors think hypertension was the cause of his nosebleedsThe dust in the garage does seem like a likely culprit considering it had been two years since it had last been cleaned out. It's just alarming that a man that hasn't experienced a nosebleed in decades would suddenly have recurrent nosebleeds but it sounds like it's not too out of the ordinary to experience them in succession like that, so that's reassuringI'm sure his PCP will grill him about picking or rubbing his nose since he has a habit of doing that, though one would hope he'd be following the doctors' instructions to not touch the area after the first nosebleedWe'll get him a humidifier. Hopefully his visit with the PCP will provide answers or more specific questions","output":"It's usually from irritation in an area called Kiesselbach's plexus in the front of the nose. The ENT can cauterize this, usually helps. Noses bleed, it is very rarely a sign of cancer or hematologic disease.Rarely the sinus packing can cause a sinus infection. His symptoms sound more like a viral URI with the dry cough and sore throat plus infecting your mother."}

{"input":"I have really appreciated your responses so far! Do you have any thoughts about the knee swelling/cyst and night pains?","output":"Night pains could be growing pains, or it could be the popliteal cyst or lymph node compressing a nerve. Usually, with an enlarged popliteal lymph node / cyst and neck ( cervical ) lymph node , I'll go for complete blood work and monospot test ( to detect mononucleosis/ Epstein Barr Virus ). Chronic bacterial and viral infection can lead to the enlargement of lymph nodes in kids ( also called lymphadenopathy ). It also happens in upper respiratory infection ( and if your pedi wants to explore further , I think they should go for a chest X-ray). Another thing that I'll always do will be the abdominal palpation to rule out enlarged spleen. In your kid's case , I'm still leaning towards the infection because he's otherwise healthy."}

{"input":"I'm trying to understand a current family situation where I believe doctors are being hasty with care.My brother in law, about 30 years old 6ft 250lbs, is currently in the hospital for acute pancreatitis due to alcoholism which stressed the one kidney he had (genetic one kidney). He's currently sedated on vent, dialysis crrt, and insulin drip. He was admitted a week ago after he called an ambulance. With only symptoms being nausea and stomach pain. Since being admitted he was bumped down to 30% oxygen with breathing therapy, 5.0 PEEP, and his vitals and blood work were all in normal ranges for an adult male. Then they lessened his sedation and he was responsive. Hand squeezing and pointing. However other blood work and vitals dipped a bit after he had breathing trouble from bile due to pancreatitis.Additional: I think initial intubation was due to shock/hyperventilation upon admission or lung infection? Doctors have said all organs are viable. Torso MRI showed a good gallbladder, liver, and lungs without liquid. Family told they should not worry about organ donation yet(family match donation to improve health). Organs are not necrotic.I'm not trying to decide if my BIL needs a DNR. That's not my choice to make. I'm just curious how doctors factor offering it or when it's needed.TLDR; So, why would a doctor recommend a DNR for such a young patient that could seemingly recover? When do you consider patients to be at a point of no return? Is it standard to ask any critical patients to sign a DNR? Do Doctors weigh stats before offering or just their judgement?If you were this patient would you ask for a DNR?","output":"Your BIL is critically unwell and requiring multiple organ support. He has de-facto multi-organ failure because his kidneys are needing dialysis, his blood pressure is being supported by drugs and he is being ventilated for what sounds like ARDS.The DNAR is if these things stop working, so he does not undergo futile CPR. If he recovers and leaves ICU theyll tear that DNAR up (or you can ask them to), but it wont affect the quality of his care to have one in place.Currently -depending on where you are- he isnt a transplant candidate due to the alcohol, as well as being critically ill."}

{"input":"Im 34, female, 5 ft. And currently depending on the day between 209 and 223 lbs ( its weird, Ill get to that.)Day 1 Normal bp: 90/60. Weight 184 pounds 5/29/21.So back in June, I was working in a facility housing homeless individuals. During my shift, I smelled what I thought it was an electrical fire or fumes coming through or exhaust system. I discovered that folks were either cooking or smoking methamphetamine in the facility, but couldnt do more then create an incident report and narrow down where this happened.I coughed a bit, Had a headache, went outside to clear my head. Didnt think anything of it. By the end of my shift It felt weird to breathe. Like I was stuffed up. Within 48 hours I was wheezing coughing and very fatigued. COVID negative. Started azithromycin and prednisone 7 day taper.By day 4 post incident I could feel It wasnt helping. Went to the hospital. 02 was in the high 70s, I was coughing so hard. Confused. BP elevated for me 120/70s. Admitted for 4 days. 3 COVID tests (2 pcr, 1 rapid) negative. No fever this whole time. Nothing came up in sputum tests or blood work other than what they explained as inflammation.According to docs notes: patient was admitted to the hospital originally for suspicious of pneumonia based on the chest x-ray reading. In speaking to the patient, her symptom is more consistent with a asthma/COPD attack and lack the usual signs symptoms of infectious pneumonia including fever, productive cough, leukocytosis, and known sick contact. Instead, her symptom was brought about by inhaling smoke at her workplace. Patient has a history of childhood asthma for which she managed at home with rescue inhaler, patient did not have any asthma issues as an adult until exposure at her work.Therefore, after admission, she was treated for an asthma/COPD exacerbation. Antibiotics initiated on admission ( levaquin, azithromycin)to a more appropriate diagnosis. She responded well to bronchodilators, nebulizer, and oral steroid. So I finish the azithromycin, prednisone and have duoneb, and albuterol to help.CT scan showed glass opacities, right side of lungs was worse. 5th PCR test negative for COVID.06/13-I go back to the doctor 6/13. I feel worse. They tell me to give it time.06/24- return to work on light duty. No more than 4 hours a day of walking.07/03-7/23- doctors are still saying give it time. My lungs sound clear. I quit my job with the county to work from home.07/29- go into urgent care because I feel like I cant breathe. Exacerbation of symptoms. They talk about referral to pulmonologist but nothing yet. More prednisone dosepak7/30-8/15- using flutter, spirometer, albuterol and duoneb still as directed. Flutter/ spirometer every hour. Albuterol every 8 hours.Hospital admission 8/16-8/21 doctors notes*Called by nursing due to worsening hypoxia. Patient was admitted for presumed asthma exacerbation with high suspicion for COVID-19 infection. She was initially on room air with SPO2 of 90%. Since her admission, her oxygen needs has been gradually increasing. She is currently on 15 LPM oxygen mask with SPO2 95%. She is becoming more tachypneic with respiratory rate up to 36.Due to lactic acidosis of 3.9 on presentation, patient was started on normal saline at 125 mL/h. She was also started on dexamethasone for presumed asthma exacerbation with possible COVID-19 infection. She is on albuterol MDI inhaler every 4 hours and every 2 hours as needed.Vital signs: Temperature 98.7, pulse of 107, respiratory rate 36, blood pressure 114/74, SPO2 95% on oxymask.On physical exam, patient is alert and oriented. She shows signs of mild respiratory distress with increased work of breathing and tachypnea. She has decreased breath sounds with mild crackles expiratory right greater than the left. No active wheezing.Laboratory studies show white count of 18.3, hemoglobin 14.7, platelets 277. Chemistry panel within normal limits with potassium of 3.9. Magnesium low at 1.7. Lactic acid improving to 2.2 from 3.9. Procalcitonin less than 0.05. D-dimer 0.41.CTA with PE protocol per my review shows no filling defects consistent with pulmonary embolism. There are mild diffuse patchy interstitial bilaterally concerning for COVID-19 infection versus asthma related pneumonitis. No pleural effusions or focal consolidations.Acute hypoxemic respiratory failureLactic acidosisHigh suspicion for COVID-19 infection. Progressive worsening with administration of IV fluids. Improving lactic acid.Plan: -Discontinue IV fluids. -Furosemide 40 mg IV once. -Continue dexamethasone 6 mg by mouth daily for 10 days. -Continue albuterol scheduled and as needed. -Magnesium sulfate 4 g IV once to assist with treatment of possible asthma exacerbation. -Check ABG. -Continue levofloxacin. -Follow-up COVID-19 testing results. Continue precautions for now. -Escalate to high flow oxygen to decrease work of breathing.Patient is critically ill. The patient continues to have: Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure the vital organ system that is affected is the: Respiratory system If untreated there is a high chance of deterioration into: Respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, and eventually death. The critical care that I am providing today is: I performed an extensive data review and discussed care with patient. I have stopped IV fluids and started diuresis with furosemide 40 mg IV. I started magnesium sulfate IV for treatment of presumed asthma exacerbation. I have escalated oxygen needs to high flow oxygen.I get discharged from this hospital stay with 2L oxygen constantly. I get to see my doctor for follow up 9/8. They tell me again to get better first. Then well look at respiratory therapy and pulmonologist and physical therapy long term. I talk to them about my weight gain and my puffy face. They say its common with steroids. I can self monitor for oxygen use.9/17 develop vertigo, confusion, nausea and vomiting. Diagnosed with colitis. COVID negative. Urgent care visit. No longer on oxygen but still exhausted.9/25- diagnosis sinusitis, vertigo from left ear infection. Lungs clear. COVID negative10/5- vertigo doesnt go away. Given meclizine. COVID negative10/17- patient noted to have slightly elevated blood pressure likely circumstantial secondary to presenting complaint (152/90). Referred to primary care physician for further evaluation.Medical Decision Making: CT temporal bones show some fluid within the left mastoid. Slight elevation of white count. Patient also has an abnormal dilatation of the right lateral ventricle on CT of her head. This is concerning in light of her ongoing nausea vomiting and vertigo over the last several weeks. Discussed with pharmacy and placed on antibiotics to cover for possible mastoiditis and discussed with hospitalist for admission for further evaluation and treatment of this ongoing vertigo and abnormal CT head. Admitted in guarded condition.10/17- COVID positive. Test results received after discharge. 10/18. 10/21 tests negative for COVIDWeight gain from June to October 21 is from 184 pounds to 222.October 27- pcp follow up after quarantine. Currently 231 pounds. BP is 148/86.Doc notes History of Pneumonia, RecurrentRecurrent pneumonias with recurrent hospitalizations Exposure to methamphetamine at work at shelter - ended up with ground glass opacities on imaging. Tested multiple times for covid, negative at that time. Has had persistent fatigue, lightheadedness, loss of energy Positive for Covid 10 days agoWeight GainGained 30 pounds since September. Has had recurrent doses of steroids with recent infections. Orthopnea Has had decreased appetite and is not eating much at all. When she does eat a lot, feels need to vomit.HypoxiaDesaturations throughout hospitalizations, was discharged on home oxygen which she was able to wean down, but does still have hypoxia when she sleeps and exertion. Concerned for sleep apnea.VertigoRecurrent episodes of vertigo especially after recent illnesses Reports that she is occasionally awoken by vertigo and hot flash symptoms. Repeat evaluations for the same - does have history of CP, recent finding of R ventricle enlargement on MRI. Some benefit with Meclizine, but has had abnormal associated symptoms including confusion, word finding difficulty. Continued to say istory of pneumonia, recurrent Suspicion for initial covid infection with negative test causing initial ground glass opacities As these are consistent with many other etiologies and she has significant other symptoms (fatigue, weight gain, hair loss, vertigo with normal TSH) will consider other etiologies ANA, RF, anti-CCP for evaluationWeight gain TSH normal in the past, so has never reflexed to T4 and T3 - will measure these Autoimmune evaluation as elsewhereHypoxia Pulmonology evaluation,possible covid long-hauler symptoms, possible other causes of groundglass opacities Sleep study and general PFTsCurrently taking : Claritin albuterol Flonase every day. Meclizine as needed. I think they help.I KNOW THIS IS A LOT. I m sorry thank you for even reading this but I wanted to be thorough.How can I advocate for myself further? What can I ask about? Any additional testing you would suggest? I dont feel like a person anymore. If I eat, clean my kitchen and walk the kids to school it takes everything I have.","output":"This is a hell of a history. From the right ventricular dilatation, hypoxia, and continued GGOs on CT scan Id say that the cause is probably the lungs. The pulmonologist is going to be your best friend here. PFTs are going to be helpful"}
{"input":"Im a 40(F), 410 and 113 pounds. I was diagnosed with hypertension in 2018, its been u fee control with Lisinopril HCTZ 20-12.5 with no issues. I was diagnosed with ADHD in December 2019 and put on methylphenidate 20 mg(2 in the morning and 1 at 1:00 pm). I always checked my blood pressure around lunch to make sure it was t too high, I never had an issue. I was diagnosed with Hashimotos last October and started seeing a functional medicine doctor last December. I was put on NP Thyroid 30 mg, moved up to 60, then doubled to 120 by June. I have had labs drawn every 3 months since December. I felt really good until around the beginning of August. My TSH was <.02 but T3 and T4 were in range so she reduced my medication to 105 mg a day.Since I was checking my BP for it being to high, I didnt realize it was going down. I happened to miss my afternoon dose of the methylphenidate and my nephrologist commented is was a little low. This was the last week of August. I had some scans done by my cardiologist the next week. I mentioned my fatigue and she suggested I stop the methylphenidate for a few days to see if that helped and to follow up with her in 2 weeks. The next few days my BP just completely went down, I ended up in the ER twice because of it. The did CT scans the first time I went and I had kidney stones. The second time I went, they though it was a kidney infection. I went back in the methylphenidate because it kept my BP up. I followed up with my cardiologist. She said everything was fine cardiology wise and to continue to take the methylphenidate without the lisinopril until I could find out the cause for the drop.At this point a reached out to my thyroid doctor to see if anything thyroid related could cause this and she said no because usually signs of over medication is high blood pressure. She said to let her know what the urologist and nephrologist said.I made an appointment with my urologist and he did a cystoscopy and ureteroscopy based off the CT from the ER visit but he found nothing wrong and no stones. The nephrologist also found nothing wrong.So last Wednesday, I finally get her to run my TSH, Free T3 and Free T4. I got the results back yesterday. My T4 is in range. TSH is <.01. T3 is 5.3. I ask about T3 thyrotoxicosis and again she says that would cause high BP. She wants me to not take my thyroid meds for 2 days then go down to 90 mg.This has been going on for 2 months. The constant up and down with my BP has me struggling. My vision is getting blurry. Im exhausted. Do I wait it out to see if what she says or should I go to the ER?","output":"With hyperthyroidism, hypertension is definitely more common, but this is not always the case. In acute crises of hyperthyroidism, blood pressure can also be lowered, particularly diastolic. In general, I'm pretty sure the problem here is the interaction between the various medications you are taking. The thyroid medication is largely overdosed considering that TSH value, and has been increased quite randomly over the various months. Also, I am not a fan of NP thyroid, since adjusting the dosage is difficult with that medication. Until the TSH is in range, we can't be 100% sure thyroid is not responsible. Look for an endocrinologist."}
{"input":"In my opinion Rasmussen would've shown up on an EEG or Scan, as the episodes are lasting a while and the activity of the inflammation would probably have been detected, though it's not impossible. I don't see how this goes in line with the arthritis, the stress fracture indicates that the loss of function and pain should not be purely neurological, maybe there are 2 problems going on simultaneously.I feel that you're a bit lost with doctors who don't do anything. So I'll suggest things to do by yourself:start a detailed diary, try to recall everything, every doctor's visit, result, try and collect the imaging done, lab results. But also start recording symptoms like ataxia, seizures, pain, atrophy. Every day. Also note any environmental changes that might occur shortly before episodes. This should include nutrition, but also stress, long exposure to sun, noise, physical activity. Get videos if you can.buy urine test strips, check her urine when it's normal 2-3 times, then when it gets dark. Check for blood, proteins, sugar. If you can, contact urine when it's brown in a clean jar and have your doctor send it to lab.if you have access to it and feel comfortable, also check blood sugar in normal and episode conditions. Again, note it done carefullyconsider to get psychological evaluation and counselling. Not only are you going through a very difficult situation, you will also avoid people saying that's only behaviour, and you're not willing to accept it. I'm not saying it is, but by acknowledging it a possibility, you rule out one more thing.consider changes in nutrition. Observe if anything changes. Might work, might not. Changes may include protein level, fat level, sugar level, etc.Then, what to do while relying on doctors:I agree with getting a second MRI. One usually isn't enough. It needs 2 to notice changes.did you get a check of the peripheral nerve system? I'd ask the neuro to check that. If they don't call back, they're probably out of ideas. Hey a new one.Get a general ultrasound of the organs.get blood test of porphyrines in normal and episode conditions.get liver and kidney blood test in normal and episode conditionsreach out to get metabolic diseases checked, like fatty acid issues, glycogen issues. Try also getting genetical analysis. I don't know about your financial situation, if you're located in usa and they don't do those, consider a visit in a different country.

{"input":"Iron vs Iron Saturation? [Hematology]Can anyone explain the practical difference between these two test values (not just the technical definition), and what it would mean if someone had normal Iron but low Iron Saturation?i.e. How could the saturation end up low but the iron level itself stay normal, physiologically?The numbers are 63 mcg and 18%, respectively, in case you're wondering, with the range listed at 50->180 for Iron and 20->48% for the Iron sat.tyvm!Age: 30, Height: 180cm, Sex: M, Non Smoker","output":"It's not easy to ELI5 this. Iron level basically just measures the amount of \"free\" iron released by your body into your bloodstream at the very second that your blood was drawn. It will change from hour to hour and day to day. The iron level is basically meaningless because it doesn't tell you anything about how much iron you actually have in your body. For example, your body needs a certain amount of iron in your blood at any given point. Even if you're iron deficient, you could have 63 on your lab and you could be iron overloaded, and it could still be 63 on your lab.The iron sat tells you indirectly how much iron is stored in your body. A low saturation means your body stores are low."}

{"input":"Kidney stones training nutrition adviceThree weeks ago I've got my first kidney stone experience, and it wasn't pleasant. I just expelled it recently and went back to the hospital to do one more check up and also to give the stone to them in order to determine what kind of stone it is... After the check up they told me the stone went out and I was ok. But apparently I have another small one forming in my other kidney. They said it's small and even if it started moving I'll probably just expel it without any problems or pain, but I need to be careful on not making it grow bigger so I should drink plenty of water. So far so good.Now my problem is; I'm underweight and I've got a sedentary job, and I'm starting an intensive six months program at the gym to build muscle mass. This program include a very strict diet plan and the consumption of protein whey powder and creatine. I read in many forums that protein powder and creatine are not ideal for subjects with kidney stones history. And when I asked the doctor after my check up he just said \"doesn't matter what you eat, just drink a lot of water\". Now, I'm not an expert, but I do believe that what you eat does matter...I'm asking for advice here because I cannot see a specialist at the moment. I was wondering if taking protein powder and creatine wont have any negative effect on the formation of other stones as long as I drink plenty of water, or if I should avoid them...And if I should avoid them, are there any substitutes I can take?To give some context. I'm male, 32 years old, 187 cm and 69 kilos, never had kidney stones before, never took creatine before, I took some protein whey powder for about 40 days one year ago. I'm not under medications. I don't have any history of diseases.Any advice is really much appreciated.","output":"If you can drink enough water, you can consume a bit more protein (not too much more; up to 60-65g is ok. More is not helpful and is wasted, unless you're training for the Olympics) without problems. Generally, taking more creatine won't help....it gets digested, and is no different than any other (much cheaper) protein. The issue is that the amount of water you need to drink to markedly reduce kidney stone formation is a lot...at least 2.5 liters a day. Most people don't manage to make it to 2 liters a day unless they force themselves to drink more water. It helps if you add a bit of flavoring (e.g lemon flavor) to it. Especially if you exercise a lot, you will need to drink even more. How much more? If your urine is totally colorless (not yellow), you're drinking enough. You can do your weight training and eat a bit more protein with no problem, but generally, one will not see any additional muscle increase by eating much more protein (more than 60 g or 65g per day). So eating 100 g of protein per day will not increase your muscle mass, and will increase the risk of kidney stones. All the protein whey powder and creatine are more psychological...you can get the same benefits by eating a couple of extra egg whites per day."}

Id had no regular uti symptoms at all other than some pressure after peeing like once. No burning, urgency etc. According to my blood work I was also dehydrated. My NP, who is also my boss & friend, gave me a prescription for Macrobid and sent off a culture. I took the antibiotics for 3 days then I got the call that my culture was negative and to stop the antibiotics. So I did. From there it was back and forth because although I was still asymptomatic I still had leukocytes in my urine. So another culture was sent off - same results 25 - 50k cfu mixed urogenital flora okay cool. So what do I do? NP tells me to just finish the antibiotics so I did. I did get a micro UA done as well and it showed 5-10 wbc with few bacteria, mucus and epithelial cells but none of my urine samples were clean catch.On Saturday after finishing my antibiotics completely I took one of those AZO uti strips after a shower and it had a small purple speck in the middle of the leukocyte pad after 2 minutes. I text my NP to let her know and she sent me in yet another prescription for antibiotics.My concern is that Im not one to take a lot of antibiotics. Actually, I havent taken antibiotics in several years so I feel uncomfortable just taking them with no identifiable bacteria present. I do have a referral to urology but its going to take some time and Im worried about getting a kidney infection. I also feel as though my concerns arent being addressed properly because of my NP being my friend, so she doesnt run the tests she would on a regular patient (IE I had to bug her for the culture and micro ua because she just immediately wanted to give me antibiotics and call it a day).Thanks in advance for any advice, I know its a long read.","output":"Asymptomatic leukocytes in urine, with no growth on a culture, from a sample that isn't a clean catch, is not a UTI and does not need antibiotics.Stop getting medical \"care\" from this person.

{"input":"Low alkaline phosphatase and low ALT(SGPT)My Child, 6 years old,18kg, male, kept complaining about sore legs (mostly around knees) for the last 4-5 years. Talked to our Gp about it few times only to be told is due to growth.It could happen all of sudden and last for a week every day or evening and then he is ok for few more weeks and then starts again. We also had months of no pain too. It is very irregular.Pain stops only after giving him pain medication along with massage.Sometimes is so bad that he is shaking from pain.We also went abroad to an private orthopedic pediatrician. Checked him and also said is probably due to growth and that is very common.Few weeks ago had another episode. He would also wake up during the night because of this pain just like before. Decided to se our gp again and asked for a referral to a specialist. It will most likely take months to get an appointment. In the mean time we did some blood tests.Results came and I'm scared. Google gives me the worst scenario for low alkaline phos. And low ALT (SGPT). I will see our gp in few days but im very concerned. Should i be that worried?

Don't smoke or use any recreational drugs, have used Ambien (5-10mg) to treat insomnia intermittently for the past 3 years. No preexisting conditions.Last week I had back-to-back instances of severe chest pain, followed by a hot flash / sweating and dizziness that persisted for about 60s. This occurred at the airport, and resulted in me getting transferred to the ED for evaluation. Paramedics conducted a few EKGs, and I heard them say there appeared something anomalous with \"B3\". At the ED, had an additional EKG, chest x-ray, and ultrasound with no acute findings. No bloodwork done. Cleared to fly, completed my work travel, returned home with a PCP appointment scheduled for this morning. The intermittent pain / palpitations / weakness / dizziness has persisted since the first episode.At PCP visit today, another EKG was done and compared to my past EKGs done at that office. My primary found an anomaly in Lead 3 (which I assume is what I misheard the medics identify), and ordered bloodwork (troponin and lipid panel, amongst others).

Make sure you ask for this because many will not request path to look. This is not trivial as patients with amyloid secondary to light chain deposition respond amazingly well to daratumumab.

I spoke with the urologist and he said this is to see if there are issues that need to be addressed by surgery that the Flomax can't help cure. I'm still not sure what this is done for and if this is standard procedure? Would it be better to just see how he responds to the Flomax and perform the procedure if he doesn't? Or is there value in doing this anyways?","output":"Flomax was given as due to the likelihood of benign prostatic hyperplasia, and pretty much every guy has an already enlarging prostate when they're above 60 anyway.The cystoscopy is to look into the urinary bladder for any issues that may not be due to the prostate (prostate would still be the number one source of problems in this age group regardless).

{"input":"My significant other's health has sharply deteriorated and after months we have no idea what it is.Hello. My (24F) boyfriend, Paul (29M), and I are fairly active. We go on road trips every year with our main stops being prime hiking spots. Paul is 5'7'' and 230 pounds. Due to his southeast asian/pacific genetics, his entire family is on the heavier side, but Paul is just as active as I am and eats well.Recently, we have gone long distance. Paul returned to live with his parents due to the pandemic while I stayed where I was. I visited him in June 2021. At this point, Paul had few symptoms, but some new minor health issues. We went hiking around Lake Tahoe and Paul was a little more out of breath than usual. He hasn't needed to use his inhaler since he was a kid, and he had to use it on this trip. We attributed this to recent wildfires in the area and poor air quality.However, Paul's health continued to sharply deteriorate. We went to Edinburgh, Scotland, in July. While hiking Arthur's Seat, Paul had to use his inhaler so many times he emptied it out. He could not get it refilled as we were out of the country. Until the end of the trip, Paul's breathing became more and more labored and he developed a persistent cough.I did not visit Paul August-November 2021. We spoke on the phone and Skyped regularly. During this time, Paul would sometimes leave the call or mute for a few minutes. He'd come back and apologize, saying he'd had to cough pretty violently and didn't want me to hear. I was concerned. I overheard one wracking, moaning coughing session and knew it was not just asthma or an irritated throat. By October 2021, the air quality in his area had greatly improved.I persuaded Paul to visit his general practitioner. His GP dismissed all of his concerns and cited Paul's being fat and asthmatic as the source of his issues, and that the issues would disappear with rest and exercise. I had to fight doctors for years to get them to take my chronic pelvic pain seriously, and was finally diagnosed with an ovarian cyst that was 8mm long and about to burst, so I have experience with self advocacy in the medical space. I helped Paul see new doctors.In mid-October 2021, Paul developed abdominal edema. Paul's feet, legs, and lower stomach were swelling up like crazy. He gained 40 pounds. He could barely move at all, even to go to the bathroom. He couldn't sleep lying down without suffocating, which only worsened his exhaustion. He went to the doctor again and was prescribed diuretics. The diuretics helped with the swelling and extra weight and within 2 weeks he was back to his regular weight, but the coughing and weakness persisted.About a month after regularly taking diuretics (November), Paul started feeling intense nausea on a weekly basis. This nausea would prompt coughing fits. Paul couldn't eat or focus while nauseated. Our calls became more and more infrequent as Paul's nausea and headaches grew. He told me sometimes the nausea would get so bad that he would vomit. There were no patterns to the vomiting--it didn't happen at a certain time of day or after meals. Sometimes it was foamy. He got a CT scan to look at his gall bladder and all results were within normal ranges. Blood tests, including labs for liver function, all came back normal. His doctor referred him to a gastroenterologist for more testing, but due to increases in COVID-19 cases, they haven't even processed his file, let alone scheduled appointments, which would be months out. A nurse anticipated he wouldn't be able to go in until February 2022, but at his rate of decline, this has me concerned for his mental wellbeing and life quality.This week, in late December 2021, I visited him and his family for Christmas. I had heard from Paul about his issues and was following closely with his medical updates, but seeing it firsthand was another thing altogether. I have never seen human suffering and sickness like this up close or cared for another human being in such an intimate way.Every single day, he has intense coughing fits and bouts of nausea where he makes vocalizations and gags, usually every few hours. At least once a day, these coughing fits are so bad that he spends 5-30 minutes vomiting in the sink. The vomiting has increased drastically. After this, the nausea alleviates, but Paul feels exhausted and has migraines. He barely eats. He barely sleeps.Today, he had three different nausea/coughing bouts that induced vomiting. One developed rapidly and he threw up in a restaurant bathroom. The last one, which just happened this evening as of writing this post, also caught him by surprise, and he vomited in the kitchen sink. The vomiting was so physically taxing that his nose bled profusely and he lost control of his bowels and peed himself. He was not strong enough to make it down the hall to the bathroom. Eventually, I assisted him into the shower. I am writing this before bed, and he is still coughing, and has a migraine. He hasn't gotten up from where he sat after taking the shower.I would appreciate any medical advice about what might be causing what Paul is going through, as well as tips for how to navigate the medical system to ensure this gets treated in the best way possible. I would like to reiterate that while neither of us are marathon running body builders, Paul (before all of this) was physically active and monitored his eating habits. He was also mentally active and had returned to school to pursue a degree in a new field. We both have families that are reasonably well off and are good support systems.Paul is one tough puppy, and reassures me that it \"isn't so bad,\" but after seeing it firsthand, I know this is not something that can continue the way it is. I am extremely worried, and caring for him is beginning to wear on me mentally. Sometimes I feel sympathy nausea when I hear the noises he makes in the bathroom.Please help in any way possible. I appreciate any and every tip, and can provide additional information if needed. Thank you very much.UPDATE 12/26:We went to the ER at 4 AM right after Christmas. Luckily, it was almost completely empty. I was not allowed to go back with him, so for the entire five hours I was sitting in the waiting room, I was only ever accompanied by one or two other people at a time.Paul's shortness of breath, fatigue, and wracking coughs got him seen quickly. He texted me updates as things progressed. He got every test I wrote down from these comments--BNP test, pulmonary work, chest x rays, GI work. An echocardigram is scheduled for next week.They found out right away that Paul's BNP results were seven times higher than usual. They said this was indicative of heart failure. They also tested Paul for COVID 19. He tested negative, but did test indicating he had some kind of viral illness.Paul's doctor concluded that he was suffering from chronic RSV that was made worse by poor genetics, asthma, and obesity. Paul did confirm he had what felt like a respiratory illness in Scotland in June, then after going to a wedding in October, then this week when he got severely ill and we found out his mother had a cold.There is no cure for RSV, but a vaccine has reached human trials. The only things Paul can do to alleviate his own suffering and avoid a heart attack is to make significant lifestyle changes and live like an immunocompromised person. I believe in his ability to achieve the former, but the latter is more difficult because of his emotionally overattached mother who brings the entire extended family out for lunches, movie nights, shopping, etc. several times a week. I'm concerned she won't take it seriously or will be in denial to avoid feeling responsible and will therefore continue to expose Paul to colds that could kill him.Paul is currently resting. He was given medication for his nausea and a new inhaler. He is doing better but still coughing. We have already started on his new food regimen. I am hoping for the best, but the pandemic has proved that people rarely take precautions for others' goodwill. Thank you for all your support. Paul might never have gone to the ER if I hadn't visited and reached out to this community.","output":"He needs to go to the emergency department. It sounds like he has some sort of heart failure causing the shortness of breath and swelling. The nausea and vomiting could be anything, though Id be concerned about electrolyte abnormalities or increased intracranial pressure. Heart failure can cause it too but not this severe Id imagineDont have a great answer tying them together thoughThis was pretty much exactly my thought process as well. Hard to tie all of these symptoms together until we start a work up, which should definitely include an Echocardiogram.

Your hyperparathyroidism is possibly the most crucial thing to get under control. Chronic hypercalcemia obviously predisposes to stones, but also to a disease called nephrocalcinosis which can be painless but sometimes causes marked pain as small rocks of calcium get lodged in the draining portion of the kidney.The other not mutually exclusive possibility is you are having ureteral spasms, which are associated with hyperparathyroidism and hypercalcemia but no stones.So it is crucial to get your hyperparathyroidism under control. Even with \"normal\" calcium this can cause kidney problems and with hypercalcemia can cause kidney failure. If this is already under control then possibly it will get better once the ongoing calcium deposition improves.

Initially, I was diagnosed after I had my first child in 2008 and my thyroid was overactive and I had thyroid antibodies that were really high. (I was put on medication.) After seeing an endocrinologist, he essentially said that I had both issues and it was rare but not unheard of. During my second pregnancy, my levels stabilized and remained stable until a couple years back when they were slightly low, but after an adjustment to some medications I was on (seroquel for sleep) they went back to stable so I wasnt medicated.

He is a picky eater, but there has been no loss of appetite.His symptoms are diarrhea. I believe this is from lactose intolerance (his dad has the same issue) because the worst episodes are after he consumes anything that could contain lactose.What I am concerned about are the dark circles beneath his eyes that have developed lately. These two symptoms (diarrhea and the dark circles) pull up neuroblastoma when I Google (I know, no Googling). I had a friend whose child had this so it hits a little closer to home, but I know its rare.He has an appointment Monday. Should I push for tests?

{"input":"Please, please help...no one can figure out whats wrong and at my wits endI've posted here before and no one ever seems to answer but I'm getting so sick that I'm basically bed bound from pain.I'm a 32 yo woman, overweight at 280 lbs, diagnosed with Sjogren's, PCOS, and on these medicines:Metoprolol for tachycardia I've had since childhood Metformin for PCOS Spironolactone for low potassium I've had since childhood (used to have constant racing heart and passed out a lot as a kid because of low potassium) as well as PCOS Nuvigil for chronic fatigue Pilocarpine for Sjogren's dryness Doxepin for ribcage pain Rosuvastatin for high cholesterol Low dose naltrexone 3mg for chronic pain Trintellix for depressionA few years ago, like 5 years now, I was healthy and 125 lbs. Then I had my 2nd child, was about 180 after she was born, and developed PCOS. I could not lose weight and gained a little more and got to about 225.In Dec 2019, my psychiatrist put me on Trileptal for mood stability. About a month later, I started to develop pitting edema and severe low ribcage pain and then had absolutely zero appetite whatsoever. I went to the ER with grade 4 edema, severe low rib pain, and blood in my urine and bloody vaginal discharge. No sign of infection, no excess protein, nothing really out of the ordinary aside from GFR that would dip into the 50s before sometimes coming up again and blood. I did get low iron and potassium, needed iv potassium several times, but they could find nothing to easily explain symptoms. This goes on for nearly a year...I got up to 325 lbs even though I could barely eat or get out of bed. I truly thought I would die.I stopped taking my medicine when I couldn't eat, and noticed I felt worse after taking it again. I also felt worse if I exercised. So I stopped Trileptal and rested for about a month and slowly seemed to recover. Then my OBGYN found uterine polyps and I had surgery to remove them. The next month, my gallbladder was removed. The next month, I had surgery to \"fix\" my urethra since they thought maybe I was having urinary problems stemming from that.But I got better and tried to be okay mentally with the constant dismissals I got from so damn many docs before I finally got some help. It was extremely difficult and I suffered with health anxiety because of it but have done great with therapy. I even managed to get my weight down to 235 after starting exercise after being sure my kidneys were fine again at a consistent GFR over 110.Then a month ago, I got a very bad case of flu. The lower rib pain came back bad. I dismissed it as flu. Recovered from it, then had several days where every muscle in my body felt like it had been lifting heavy weights for days. Everything hurt, and doc said maybe mild myositis from flu. Then I noticed urinary changes. I normally have frequent urination, going a few times a night and usually at least every hour or more. No one can find a cause though. But suddenly not going at night at all and only going like 3 times in the day. Started having white flecks in urine sometimes and strong odor. Then urinalysis started showing blood in urine consistently. Then sharp pains in urethra all the way to anus at times, which I'd had before as well. I have brown vaginal discharge too. A few days ago, I couldn't pee at all and was sent to the er. They can find no reason for my symptoms...nothing on ct, no bacteria in culture, no stones, no nothing. No one knows, but I had to have a foley catheter inserted (was very painful like stabbing) because I had retention and could not pee. Was sent home with it and had it removed next day and I was able to pee again but then developed pitting edema. It's currently grade 1. No cause can be found.I will add in case it is relevant, just before the flu, my pcm referred me to neurology for mris of head and spine and nerve conduction test. I've been having nerve pain for several months. Buzzing, tingling, numbness, shocks, in various places for sustained periods and sometimes just sudden and then goes away. She was thinking the lower rib cage pain may actually be nerve pain since it feels burning at times like the burning headaches in the base of my skull and my neck. My thyroid is sometimes hypo but usually fine, my b12 and magnesium are normal, and I do not have any markers of diabetes other than just being fat currently. My grandma has MS, which she believes was healed by Jesus, but I know enough about it to know that's what she's trying to rule out I'm pretty sure.Can anyone, please , give me some insight about what might be wrong with me? I'm in so much pain with the gnawing, burning pain in the bottom of my ribcage and the electric shock pains in my urethra and anus, and I am so scared of the fact I've got urinary bleeding, vaginal bleeding, and putting edema but no one knows what's up. I've seen rheumatology, nephrology, urology, obgyn, even was sent to a hematology oncologist as a hail-mary.I stay away from Googleing anything because for one, I have too many symptoms to easily fit in a search bar, and I know there's no good coming out of looking at it anyway. I have gotten better care since changing hospital systems after last time this happened, the urologist I saw kept insisting the blood in my urine was from my vagina even though I still had blood in my urine after a catheter was used to sample, and I e just had a really hard time getting docs to push to figure out what's wrong. It feels like since I don't appear to be imminently dying, and they dismiss my pain and exhaustion, no one sees a point in helping.So sorry for the long post but I'm just trying to give as much context as I can. Please let me know if you have any questions as I'm happy to answer.","output":"In the absence of objective findings on imaging and testing, it is possible that weight in itself can cause the multi-system problems that you have.

{"input":"Respiratory restrictive pattern, unknown cause please help.I am 21 years old male.I have started having bad shortness of breath the past 4 months. I have seen so many doctors and this is the results so far.The originally test to prove there is something going on is the respiratory function test, I cant interpret all the results but the pulmologist said my breathing shows a restrictive pattern with 65% of expected lung capacity and velocity. This test has been repeated every month with similar results. Gas transfer was 95-100% not indicating lung disease.Got a ct scan of chest with dye to rule out lung disease or to see if anything else is on my lungs but it came back clear other than enlarged thymus gland.They thought it might be respritory muscle weakness although the neurologist said unlikely as when I am lying down the respiratory test shows similar results as to standing.Cardiac possibilities cleared by cardiologist.The cardiologist, pulmologist and neurologist are at a loss and have determined to just hope it doesnt get worse. Please help.","output":"Restrictive pattern on PFTs essentially fall into three categories, unfortunately you've had them all investigated. It can be the lungs themselves (i.e. fibrosis, or stiff lungs), chest wall noncompliance (think of terrible scoliosis, severe obesity, etc), or neuromuscular disease. The first two are typically pretty easy to diagnose, neuromuscular disease can be very difficult. There is no gold standard for how to determine if restriction is related to neuromuscular disease, but the sitting/supine spirometry is often done as one piece of data (as it appears you have done).Have you done a MIP/MEP (maximal inspiratory pressure and maximal expiratory pressure)? A low MIP tends to indicate diaphragmatic problems, and a low MEP indicates problems with chest wall strength. Like the sitting/supine spirometry, these must be interpreted with caution, as they are not truly gold standard for anything.If all else fails, there is always the Cardiopulmonary Exercise Test (CPET). It's basically a test that measures your heart and lung function through maximal exercise to determine where exercise intolerance may be coming from. It's not always available in all places and can be very difficult to interpret.All in all, with your story I would put my money on a neuromuscular issue. I think the neurologist ruling it out based on the positional spirometry alone is premature. Bring up the MIP/MEP and CPET to your pulmonologist and see what he/she thinks.Mind if I ask where you are being evaluated? You would likely benefit from going to a tertiary care center, such as affiliated with an academic or university medical center. Depending on where you are located I could suggest some places to find docs who'd be interested in you."}

{"input":"Rheumatology- [49][female] Methotrexate and ColdMy mom is a patient of La county hospitals but does/t have a PCP only a specialty clinic doctor that she sees every 3 months so Im hoping to get some advice. She recently got a cold this past weekend, she tested for covid and had a negative result. She has a cough and is taking Acetaminophen from OTC. She is due to take Methotrexate today due to her Lupus treatment for her flare. Her doctor recently increased her dose to 10 pills weekly which I understand to be an immunosuppressant. How does this affect her if she has a cold? Should she skip until she gets better?","output":"That's a spectacular question,I wouldn't panic, I don't think it's radically dangerous but this does merit a phone call to the doctor's office. It's important and should be answered by someone who understands her particular history with lupus quite well.I say don't panic because it is not radically uncommon for people to take immunosuppressive drugs when they are in fact sick with an infection, that is the whole basis of taking steroids(the most iconic immunosuppressive drugs) when you have covid, it's looked at like a double-edged sword. So that's good with bad. In theory it could make her cold much more intense and last much longer than it would in a normal person .I don't know how bad her lupus flare is and if that's going to hurt her more withholding the drugs; or how bad her cold is, and if she's really going to fall apart, so I will refrain for making an explicit recommendation.I recommend you get this specialist to give the recommendation, but either way giving it or holding it, she will probably be okay for the meanwhile."}

Can happen in times of high stress. Usually benign, sometimes in the setting of new arrhythmia. Beta blockers can reduce occurrence so maybe cardiology might want to discuss atenolol dose.Sounds like you might getting into a cycle that precedes panic attacks which makes people feel like they are having a heart attack eg short of breath, chest pain. Then fear of a similar episode happening again causes stress and then you cycle right back into stress induced PACs. Breathing exercises are golden when you feel youre about to enter one of these cycles. In through the nose 4 seconds, out through the mouth for 6 seconds. Do this at least 4 times and focus on breathing.See what cardiology has to say. Very unlikely anything serious."}

{"input":"Should I see a Rheumatologist?Hi I am 26F, 150lbs, currently only taking hormonal birth control (sprintec). I have been dealing with recurring hand and arm pain for the past four months or so. I'd estimate since the end of January 2023. It started as a sort of tingly feeling in my fingers with some pain around the proximal interphalangeal joint in all 10 of them. I wouldn't describe the tingling as numbness exactly, as it's not the pins and needles that others use to describe it, but it is constant. The pain is in both hands, but my right hand is worse as that is my dominant hand. As there is no specific moment I can remember when this started, I thought this might have been carpal tunnel or some other overuse injury from spending time knitting & crocheting as well as being on the computer 8-10 hours a day for my job/fun. I stopped knitting as much and when it didn't get better around a month in I stopped knitting completely. The pain does get worse when I use the computer and my phone so I am trying to limit the use of both and I have already switched to using a vertical mouse which didn't seem to make a difference. Specifically when I click the mouse with my right pointer finger I feel a pinch between my ring and pinky fingersI went to an orthopedic hand surgeon who said that he didn't think it was carpal tunnel as those are unusual symptoms for it and even more unusual to be experiencing the pain in both hands. He took X-rays that he said looked normal, and he ordered a bunch of blood tests for me including one for Rheumatoid factor. He also prescribed me physical therapy after I complained about still being in pain. The physical therapist did a bunch of intake tests that showed my grip strength and other strengths were on the low end, but normal and he seemed stumped on how to help me. After 3 sessions of in office physical therapy I did not seem to get better and if anything it's worse. As I now feel regular pain up my arms around my forearm and triceps (feels kind of like a tight stretching) in addition to the pain I described earlier. Also in the last couple of weeks I've experienced actual numbness in both of my pinkys, on seperate occasions. For the record I wasn't as diligent with the PT as I could have been, ie sometimes I would do exercises only once or twice a day instead of the recommended 2-3 times. I was diligent about the heat he recommended though.My blood tests came back all negative so the doctor said that he's at a loss, suggested I maybe make an appointment with a rheumatologist and prescribed me a 4mg medrol dose pack as a last ditch effort. During and after the prednisone I didn't really notice a change in pain levels. That coupled with the negative Rheumatoid Factor suggests to me that maybe there is no inflammation causing this? But I know that seronegative rheumatoid factor exists, hence why I'm now asking on reddit. Does it seem like this could be RA? Would it be worth it to go to the Rheumatologist for this? Was my doctor just wrong and it is some kind of overuse injury and I should just try a new orthopedic doctor? Maybe someone less specialized in the hands because the physical therapist suggested it might be a spinal issue since the pain is traveling up my arms. Should I just give up on doctors and try to be more diligent about the physical therapy on my own?For the record here are all the blood tests I got:CBC W/PLAT AUTOMATED DIFF - Only showed I have a slightly low red blood cell countANA PANELSEDIMENTATION RATEC-REACTIVE PROTEINRHEUMATOID FACTORURIC ACIDHLA-B27 ANTIGENCYCLIC CITRUL PEPTIDE ABSANACHOICE(R) SPECIFIC ANTIBODIES W/RFLX TO DSDNA","output":"Picture does not sound rheumatologic to me.

{"input":"Thank you for your comment. What worries me is that Im wearing a jacket and am using a blanket in bed right now.","output":"Throw away your thermometer for an easier life."}
{"input":"Thank you so much for replying.I don't actually remember how they ruled it out, but I brought it up to multiple specialists who had various reasons why it wasn't. But even still, I did quit vaping/nicotine for 9 months during this and the condition continued to worsen. I started using my vape lightly again recently, but I will stop 100%.Is it possibly reversible if I stop immediately? (I'm stopping regardless after reading your message).And just one more question, I also thought obvious PAD but they say it's ruled out because no atherosclerosis and normal doppler. Is that inaccurate?","output":"You can still have an inflammatory/autoimmune process causing similar symptoms.I dont know what workup youve had, but ruling out all autoimmune conditions is a pretty significant claim, though with the right lab work you can estimate a likelihood.Id consider some of the vasculitides/rheumatic conditions such as anti phospholipid syndrome, cryoglobulunemic vasculitis, etc. they often come with other manifestations but there is obviously not a full history and physical exam above.Many of these are associated with autoimmune diseases such as lupus, but they are not pathognomonic by any means.Have they done a biopsy?"}
{"input":"Thank you so much for the education :)","output":"Did you place the back of the watch on your chest (in the V2 lead position) and then touch the crown with your finger to get this? If so, then the inverted T wave you are concerned about would not be a valid finding. The voltages in the precordial (V) leads in a 12 lead EKG are measured in relation to the average of the 4 limb leads, not just one arm which the watch is doing. EKG tracings from Apple Watches are good for determining heart rhythms but not much else."}
{"input":"Thank you so much! Also, please let me know if you need more details/clarity on his medical history.","output":"I'm not a urologist, but I imagine the recommendation was for a transurethral resection of prostate (TURP). Relatively routine from my perspective."}
{"input":"Thank you, Doc. So salicylic acid should work better than selenium sulfide? Selsun Blue and Head and Shoulders have both.Correct, I have been rubbing it in gently and washing it out after 10 minutes.","output":"There is no evidence that one active ingredient in these shampoos works better than another for seborrheic dermatitis. I was making a suggestion to help remove the adherent scale."}
{"input":"Thanks for your comment. The pediatricians drilled it in our heads that it was rare that it happened in the first place, even at 5 days. But I cant help but shake the feeling that even though its rare to happen again, we were already one of the rare ones it happened to the first time around. They made it seem as its way more unlikely for it to happen to children and more common in adults. When we saw her vomiting fresh blood we thought we were going to lose her.Will the recauterization of the spot where they found her active bleeding (noted as left superior tonsillar fossa) reset the clock on healing the whole area? Diffuse oozing in the right, clots bilaterally were also listed on our discharge papers.","output":"In 25 years of practicing ENT Ive only seen one re-bleed.The cautery sets the clock back just in that one specific spot. Theres no evidence postop bleeding is more common in adults, thats an old wives tale.Big picture here, this was a small setback your child will be fine."}
{"input":"Thanks. That's kind of what I gathered from my uneducated Googling, but I just don't have any fatigue, brittle nails, hair etc. The only symptoms of worry (which started this whole thing) have been crazy acid reflux, nausea , bloatedness, abdominal aches and pains and sharp flank pains.","output":"The deficiency isnt big enough yet to affect your hb more something to be aware ofThe other symptoms sounds like something else. Consider this probable iron deficiency as an accidental find during tests"}
{"input":"The UK released last night that anyone whos routinely offered a flu vaccine on the NHS due to a chronic condition is now classed in the high risk group Ive got digestive tract paralysis, an ileostomy, dysautonomia, chronic joint pain, chronic fatigue and urinary retention as my main conditions None of these affect my heart or lungs so I accept that I may be higher risk to catch it but in my eyes I shouldnt be higher risk of getting complications except maybe my potassium dropping lower than usual if I struggle with oral intake/get the rare diarrhoea Do you think Im right in my assessment of my risk or would you consider someone like me high risk for complications too ? Im a 24 year old female by the way who does have a history of being hospitalised with chest infections","output":"Cannot comment on individual risk.As in the above post age is the biggest risk factor for severe disease."}
{"input":"The doctor, the mouth pain, the difficulty of swallowing, the difficulty of breathing, what is the cause of these symptoms?","output":"Unfortunately, these symptoms can be caused by cancer of the esophagus, which makes it difficult to swallow if there's a tumor in the esophagus, which can cause respiratory problems because of pressure on other organs, such as the lungs."}
{"input":"The history isnt convincing for anything heart failure related causing your fluid retention.What is far more likely is that its a side effect of your contraceptive pill. Fluid retention is listed as a common or very common side effect of your particular medication.","output":"Often, but not always. Your physiology changes over time so sometimes you may start to see side effects that you previously didnt."}
{"input":"The only time percentiles posed a problem for my kiddos was when they were used to detect a head growth problem in one of my kiddos  extra imaging was requested and there was an actual reason for the extreme jump off of the datum points off of the growth curve.Would it be fair to suggest that growth curves and percentiles are used to detect changes in growth?","output":"Yes, that's a good way to explain it. When we're watching from visit to visit, we're looking at the trend in percentile over time.50th percentile would be exactly average, 90% percentile means in a room of 100 kids his age hes heavier than 90 of them."}

Did you travel anywhere before symptoms began where you walked barefoot on soil/sand or drank water from a source you dont usually drink from?","output":"People sure do love parasites around here. Unlikely the explanation for OP.From your comment below:Entamoeba - This causes colitis, which is bloody diarrhea, not alternating stools and RUQ pain like OP describes.Liver flukes - Almost always asymptomatic. But, easy to check for with a stool O&P like you suggest.Cystic echinococcus - OP had a liver ultrasound. CE would show a bunch of cysts, and should be apparent to the radiologist."}

{"input":"There's bladder discomfort, frequent urination at night, vaginal secretions, and even blood mixed with urine.","output":"It could be a hip edema, which is a condition in which the pelvic muscles are weakened so that the bladder, the uterus, the workplace, the pelvic organs get out of place and press on the wall."}
{"input":"There's doctors, kidney symptoms, upper abdominal pain, abdominal suffocation, reflux, back pain.","output":"It's possible that you're suffering from an inflammation of your bladder."}

{"input":"This is very helpful, thank you. Regarding the improvement and them seeing anything on the CT - the report on the CT only identified a single stroke and described it as sub-acute so I was told it was likely to have happened a couple of days prior. I thought much the same as you originally, minor stroke on the Thursday and larger stroke sometime Saturday night into Sunday but I was told no.I have been intending on getting in touch with PALS for a while now and this should give me the push I need, at this point I'm not even sure what the situation with the bleed was by the time the stroke happened. It's not been an issue since he was moved to the stroke ward and they resumed anticoagulation (high dose aspirin originally and then unfractioned heparin infusion).","output":"One thing worth noting is that inflammation after a stroke is worst ~72 hours afterward. The worsening symptoms a few days later may have been related to swelling and inflammation."}
{"input":"This response is a bit harsh, and repetitive. Perhaps you could assist the OP by describing what YOU consider to be meaningful and relevant, as it appears she is trying. Also, you are the one with the degree.","output":"Good suggestion. I need precise information on the anatomic distribution of the hair loss. Additionally, I need information on the appearance of the scalp and the hair follicle appearance in involved and uninvolved areas."}

Not taking anything to prevent them but Ive reduced sodium and drink a lot of water.In the last 2 months or so Ive had 2 instances of long-ish periods of time where I have visible blood in my urine (sometimes enough that it resembles menstrual blood and other times the tissue is just pink when I wipe) along with abdominal pain and sometimes flank pain. Both times Ive been treated with antibiotics but Ive had negative urine culture. Urinalysis showed blood, mucus and bacteria a couple months ago but Im not sure what my most recent showed. Ive now had blood in my urine since June 26th and what feels like menstrual cramps. I pee fairly often and get up a couple times a night. My last 24 hour urine collection showed big improvements and my kidney ultrasound looked good.Is there anything else this could be besides a UTI? Im hoping my urologist follows up after she called in antibiotics on July 7th.","output":"How were the urine samples collected? I really hope that they didn't just give you a cup to pee in.Macrohematuria in women can be caused by many things, the most common: hemorragical cystitis (infection) or urolithiasis (not just kidney stones but ureter stones or bladder stones) or an urothel carcinom of the bladder/ureter/renal pelvis, rarely but possible with RCC or a urethral caruncle"}

{"input":"What do these results mean?24F, 176cm 46kg. I have hypermobile ehlers danlos & likely gastroparesis, my stomach shut down just over a year ago & I rely solely on a nasojejunal tube for nutrition, hydration and medication. I've gained 8kg from my most unwell point, but my weight has been going on a bit slowly & my blood sugars are constantly low despite feeds. I've also had issues on & off with my liver and recurrent kidney and bladder infections.I had an ultrasound followed by an MRI last year, but I didn't see the results until I called the hospital & requested the results a few months ago. It seemed to suggest nutcracker syndrome, which I know can be related to SMAS. But I've also heard MALS? I don't understand the results, and no doctor has ever even told me them, let alone explained them to me.'Ultrasound: The left renal vein was not clearly visualised crossing anterior to the aorta, and the left gonadal vein appeared dilated with reversal of flow heading downwards into the pelvis. The appearances raise the possibility of nutcracker syndrome.MRI: The aortic-SMA angle is somewhat reduced, assessed at between 17 and 30 degrees on the low quality reformatted images (normal range 38 to 65 degrees).'What does this all mean?","output":"Basically there isnt enough fat between your superior mesenteric and aorta to prevent the SMA from crushing your left renal vein and duodenum (beginning portion of GI tract). I have attached a nice diagram below.Your BMI is 15 which is waaay underweight. I understand how hard it is for you to gain weight without a functioning GI tract but weight gain can help decompress structures through fat pad support. There are also surgical options but many will have you try to gain weight before offering surgery. Its often a multidisciplinary team approach in treatment. GI or vascular surgery would be most appropriate to consult about options."}
{"input":"What's the problem with having a doctor, a faint, burning chest pain, cough, dry mouth, low vision?","output":"You can experience a hypertonic hyperplastic hyperketon condition that can occur in an uncontrolled Type 2 diabetic, which is a serious condition that requires immediate treatment."}

{"input":"Worried about a blood cancer but doctors aren't? Petechiae that come and go?25M, 6'0, White, 175lbs. Manual Labor Job, lifted weights until june 6th (mostly due to workload) No alcohol/smoking, only THC gummies. USA(Prior Health Concerns)-Rosacea-Late Dec 2020 I tested negative for covid, unbearable stomach pain/bloating whenever I ate. Lost 11lbs over 7 days until I could finally eat again. Saw GastroEnter early Jan '21. Gastroscopy, upper endo, colonoscopy. All biopsied, no inflammation. No blood in stool. Total mystery to them that resolved and never came back. Had remnant pains the next few months, tingles/tickles around torso, all resolved in time with no medications/treatments.-August 2nd, had knot under left armpit for two months ultrasounded, ruled benign, not pathologically enlarged(Current Health Issues)I've had issues the last few months. My hands felt cold/stiff in the fingers, no pain. This lasted only a few days before going away, (June 1st). GP said Raynaud's. Almost as soon as the finger issues stopped, I went to the ENT for a migratory feeling of fullness in my throat for multiple weeks that turned out to be acid reflux, and issue I have had off and on for the last handfuls of years (Maybe once a year), but never like this. I'm on omeprazole 20mg daily and that has been resolved. Back issues (now believed by trial/error to be caused by highly acidic food (Homemade hot sauces) have all but recently resolved. Migratory from spine to flanks, almost always symmetrical radiating irritation/tightness. Only two instances of sharp pains when eating spicy/acidic food, so I associate that with the acid reflux. These back issues never affected my mobility, and only ever had an issue like this when I had the moderna vaccines (Which kicked my ass for three days each)My biggest concerns have been my blood work. Initially my doctor was worried about my platelets on June 6th. (Still had back issues). I was on a plant based diet, and he recommended I go off it because he has no experience with it until we see what's happening. I resumed a traditional diet until follow up bloods and peripheral smear on June 22nd. Almost everything bounced back into normal range, or at the very least recovered significantly. No concerns on his end other than slightly low wbc, peripheral smear great. I felt better, and resumed a plant based diet until I felt started to have back/hand issues again.Aug 2nd - I also noticed some flat individual dots on my trunk/legs. Only about 5 at the time. Some of which are raised. He said they are petechiae, never go away, and that was that. Two of which I vaguely remember noticing a few years ago but cannot be certain. More bloodwork and smear done. Both smear results are of no concern to GP or hematologist (Facility requires all bloodwork reviewed by Hematology across the street as per policy)The last handful of days I noticed a cluster under my left armpit of petechiae, which had mostly faded before returning again today, but not as prominent. I have a hematology appointment on the 15th. Both doctors are not concerned of Leukemia, but Hematologist is still interested to see what's up and GP said all his resources are exhausted.I have no organ enlargements/lymph node enlargement/no fatigue/nightsweats/weight loss. No inflammatory markers, healthy kidneys/liver/spleen. No reduction in appetite (Quite the opposite) Only Low wbc and mild hand symptoms that come and go that had remedied when returning to traditional diet but dropped since returning to plant based. The last three days I have noticed minor \"tickles\" around my body. I wouldn't say itching. Similar to the tingles I would get when I had my stomach issues about 3 years ago. None of my symptoms ever got worse at night, quite the opposite.(Questions)Would cancer symptoms wane and reoccur? Would my bloods have recovered so fast if I it was? I honestly don't know what to think at this point. I feel like by now if it was leukemia it would have been caught in the blood smears or my conditions would have worsened, not (mostly) resolved?I understand my WBC is low, but would it be considered pathologically so? All abnormal labs are posted, everything else fell into normal rangeshttps://imgur.com/FZEIlnE (Bloodwork)https://imgur.com/Lhw9UC1 (Petechiae)","output":"Blood smears are diagnostic for blood cancers. If theyre normal, you dont have blood cancer."}
{"input":"Would a cbc with differential show blasts if they are present? I got a cbc recently and it didn't even have a line item for blasts. Just neutrophil, lymphocyte, monocyte, eosonophil and basophil?","output":"The standard is to report blasts if they are present."}
{"input":"Wouldnt talking to a dietitian help or even be a good idea for anyone considering something like this? Or is that not in line with what a dietician would normally advise on?","output":"She can if she wants. If she's not familiar with vegan diets, it could be a good idea.The intake of protein, fats and other micros could become a problem. Remember a healthy diet is first, balanced and second, a diet you can stick to."}
{"input":"Yea I watched my son die of a PE we knew it was eventually going to happen and the gurgling made me immediately think of that. Sorry for your loss. Please consider some counseling as it can really help work through dealing with unexpected deaths.","output":"Sorry for your loss. If she actually had SQ emphysema when you saw her that day, I would be concerned that she may have had an air leak and may have developed a tension pneumothorax. A tension pneumothorax can potentially lead to progressive shortness of breath and cardiac tamponade which would drop her blood pressure. In that situation, I would have expected her to be having some chest pain prior to the event and for symptoms to build up. If this happened very suddenly, then I agree that a pulmonary embolus is more likely."}
{"input":"[16M] So 2 days ago i felt pain on my right eyelid, the pain is like bruise, I don't really care about it. The next day the pain wasn't gone, so I checked \"Inside\" of my eyelid and it's more red than the left side, now i am worried about this. My current hospital only accepts critical/emergency cases so I can't go there for now. What should I do about it? Is it bleeding inside?Edit : Nearby pharmacist says it's an infection/allergy and gave me eyedrop \"DexOph\", could this help me?","output":"Ophthalmologist here. The picture isnt great, but it looks pretty normal to me. I wouldnt just use Dexoph without seeing an ophthalmologist. Dexoph is dexamethasone which is a steroid. Unregulated use of steroid eye drops can lead to both premature cataracts and glaucoma.You should go see an ophthalmologist.Edit: can you upload a higher pixel picture of the affected eye along with a picture of the normal eye for comparison?"}
{"input":"any heme docs who can interpret this CBC?24M, 5'10, 200 lbs, East-Asian.Elevated BP (usually around 140/90), No alcohol use, no drug use. not on any medications. Not diagnosed with any conditions. Family history of DM2, High Blood Pressure.No complaint and no symptoms of any kind, but I recently went to my PCP to get a checkup due to an older sibling being diagnosed with DM2 recently. The physician ordered a CBC with differential/platelet and CMP. CMP results were completetly normal, but many markers for the CBC were off from the reference values.I asked my PCP the significance of the results and he told me that he's not quite sure. Then, to make sure that the results are not due to lab error, he had me take a second blood test about 3 weeks after the results of the previous one. The test this time included Iron and TIBC as well as Ferritin. Results basically came back identical to the results of the first test.He basically asked me to schedule a visit with hematology because he's not sure how to interpret the results. I just scheduled a visit with a hematology group near me but it'll be mid august before i can see them. Seen as I just need someone to interpret my CBC results, i figured it might be quicker if one of the docs here on reddit can do a quick reading so i can have peace of mindThe results the second test (with comparision to the values of the initial test) are as follows:https://imgur.com/a/gxgM99T","output":"Low MCV like this with normal hemoglobin is likely a hemoglobinopathy like thalassemia. Could also be something like spherocytosis. Hematology should look at a blood smear, maybe run hemoglobin electrophoresis and can give you a more definite answer as to what is going on. Your RDW being elevated suggests that you're churning out new cells or possibly have a vitamin deficiency. Lots to discuss with hematology here but nothing that is ominous or emergent. Normal ferritin suggests that you aren't iron deficient which was tested because of low MCV."}
{"input":"can cutting off sugar cure an upper respiratory infection?20F, 5'4, 116 lbs., do not drink, do not smoke/drink/use drugs, USAI got sick around October 29, 2022, after going to the doctor, I was prescribed a 10-day antibiotic dose that was finished around November 11. Although my harsh symptoms were gone afterward, such as tiredness, body ache, and congestion, all of a sudden after the antibiotics I got this harsh cough that was productive with green mucus. The cough was not a dry cough like I had before/during my antibiotics but rather came from my chest and is very loud. I have trouble breathing with this cough. Knowing its been around 40 days and I haven't stopped coughing so much so my back is killing me from the constant coughing, 4 days ago I went to the doctor. He basically told me to cut off sugar from my diet, no junk food, and eat only vegetables and soup for 20 days and I should feel better. (I was a little confused about this suggestion because he never asked about my diet beforehand, previously, I didn't eat junk food every day and I include veggies and fruit in almost every meal. I am quite active and have been consistently healthy.) I was not prescribed anything that can help my mucus but was prescribed cough syrup and an inhaler.I am not sure if a change in diet is a solution and I'm wondering if I should ask for a chest x-ray because I have difficulty breathing.Also this doctor didn't even check my breathing until I had asked him to. He said my lungs sounded fine but did hear mucus in my bronchi.Side note: after finishing my antibiotics I took probiotic pills and drank kombucha, could that have caused this?","output":"Generally speaking, eating less sugar and increasing plant-based food is a good thing for your health; but you shouldnt expect this change to make any real difference with an acute infection. I expect in 20 days youre going to feel a lot better regardless of a change in your diet."}
{"input":"can i still grow taller? (16f)it's my biggest insecurity to the point i feel like taking my life over it, i know it sounds like i'm exaggerating but it's just been so bad for the last few years. i don't even want to leave the house over it most times.i'm 16, 5\"2, 40kg. i had a really bad eating disorder for the last few years and i'm barely eating 600/700 calories a day. i know this is making me malnourished and probably is a reason why i didn't grow that much. but i will put in the effort to recover if it means i'll grow taller. my parents are 5\"0 and 5\"9. i want to be at least 5\"4 which is only two inches but it seems impossible. i just really want to know if i can grow still because it's eating me up alive.","output":"5'2\" is an extremely normal height. I'm sorry to hear about your eating disorder but you're a completely normal height"}
{"input":"hanks for your response, I did ask that he see a doctor but he is very stubborn and just accepts if its my time then oh well. So Im not expecting much here unfortunately.","output":"Ugh. Im sorry. So hard to watch a parent do that. Be persistent. Enlist other family members. Avoidant behavior is very common. Especially for healthcare workers."}
{"input":"have an academic question about asymptomatic carriers of covid-19.people who are infected but not showing symptoms - does that mean their body is not responding to the infection, and not creating antibodies to destroy the invading virus?If that's so, does that mean they will be able to infect other people way past two weeks?","output":"Absolutely they are having a normal immune response."}
{"input":"i meant atypical, im sorry! it was in the notes for the test result.He has fever just about every day, if its not fever, its right under fever (99.9-100.3) but most days its 100.4 or higher. He usually gets sick 1-3 times a month, and he stays sick and his pediatrician says thats too much especially for a kiddo not in day care or anything like that. Hes been hospitalized a few times and they havent been able to figure out what causes it. This is something weve been dealing with pretty much since he was born.","output":"Has he ever had a CRP or ferritin? What was the total WBC and neutrophils on the blood count?I think hematology is unlikely to solve this for you. Between immuno and rheum they may have some recommended tests for uncommon causes of recurrent fevers."}
{"input":"okay thanks. ill meet up with a pulmonologist most likely. how likely would something malignant cause this?","output":"Very unlikely. We dont use it as a test to look for malignancy."}
{"input":"please help. 2 low wbc in a row, now seeing hematologyMy husband. Male, 48. Healthy.First wbc 3.5, no differential was done. Everything else normal.3 weeks later wbc 2.8 and neutrophils 1.4 with 1.5 being the lowest level for norm. Says 50.4%. All other levels still normal, monocytes normal but higher end. 0 immature granulocytes.Doctor said he knows we are scared, but really, really doesn't think it's cancer. Thinks most likely was fighting some kind of virus, but sending to hematology to be sure. Also has 2 immediate family members with rheumatoid arthritis.I'm very scared.","output":"When just the WBC is low, your doctor is right, it's usually recovery from an infection. Cancer tends to cause more than one type of blood cell to be low, which doesn't seem to be the case."}
